- [Fixes](#fixes)


### API Changes

*   Shaders: Added: Added a possibility to query preprocessed shader data for a given variant ([1364378](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/no-way-to-get-preprocessed-data-using-pass-dot-compilevariant))

### Fixes

*   Android: Further improve build times, when sequential build is done with no changes in project. Previously Unity was moving apk/aab from gradle project to final location, thus forcing the gradle to rebuild apk/aab on sequential builds, Unity will perform a copy instead now. Our tests show that sequential build times improved by 50%, for ex., dropping from 12 seconds to 5 seconds. (1361602)
    
*   Android: Workaround a problem where using logcat would leak pipes on OSX. The underlying problem seems to be with C# Process class, where if you redirect streams and dispose process, the pipes would remain opened. This will be investigated separatly. ([1303618](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-adb-functionality-leaks-a-pipe-causes-too-many-open-files-error))
    
*   Animation: Fixed an issue where an assert was triggered upon rebuilding an animation legacy component. ([1330001](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assertion-failed-on-expression-m-curves-when-playing-animation-after-reenabling-object))
    
*   Asset Bundles: Improved performance of Asset Bundle building when many bundles exist. ([1358059](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/building-process-of-the-assetbundles-is-slow-when-the-file-count-is-huge))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where MonoScripts in plugins that were dependent on plugins in other folders could fail to import when reimporting all assets. ([1345854](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mono-scripts-in-dlls-fail-to-import-when-reimporting-all-assets))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed exception that Rider would catch when Disposing instances of the ArtifactInfo class. ([1359723](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/artifactinfo-dot-internal-destroy-exception-thrown-when-in-play-mode-while-using-rider-debugger))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Improved opening time of Import Activity Window. ([1343709](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/import-activity-window-takes-long-time-to-open))
    
*   Audio: Fixed exposing multiple send levels in the audio mixer not working correctly. Note: previously created mixers with exposed send levels will cause a warning to be logged on editor startup and the send levels will have to be re-exposed. ([1285638](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/audio-mixer-unable-to-expose-other-send-level-parameters-when-one-is-already-exposed))
    
*   Editor: Fixed windows editor sometimes getting into a "script assemblies are locked" state after invoking a modal dialog from a C# script. ([1367358](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/windows-asemblies-get-locked-when-trying-to-recompile-after-opening-and-closing-openfolderpanel-window))
    
*   GI: Environment lighting should not be affected by the Cast Shadows flag on the Mesh Renderer. ([1348581](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gpuplm-meshrenderer-castshadows-property-set-to-off-disables-baked-indirect-shadows))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed a crash in ray tracing shaders when different ray payload structures are used throughout shaders that are used in a ray tracing dispatch. ([1351293](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dxr-crash-after-domain-reload-after-changing-which-shader-pass-to-use-for-raytracing-shader))

*   Graphics: Fixed inconsistent behavior of Async Readbacks in the scene view. (1369329)

*   iOS: Stop dark mode native mobile input's background from going transparent when it's empty. ([1367091](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-multi-line-mobile-input-fields-show-transparent-background-when-dark-mode-is-enabled-and-no-text-is-in-the-field))

*   Mono: Fixed a crash that would occur when a recursive struct was used in user code. ([1248911](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-when-loading-scriptableobject-with-list-slash-array-of-serializable-structs-with-a-static-member-of-another-struct))
