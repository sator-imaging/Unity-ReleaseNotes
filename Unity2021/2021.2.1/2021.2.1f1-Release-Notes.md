## 2021.2.1f1 Release Notes


### API Changes
<ul>
<li>Shaders: Added: Added a possibility to query preprocessed shader data for a given variant (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/no-way-to-get-preprocessed-data-using-pass-dot-compilevariant">1364378</a>)</li>
</ul>

### Fixes
<ul>
<li><p>Android: Further improve build times, when sequential build is done with no changes in project. Previously Unity was moving apk/aab from gradle project to final location, thus forcing the gradle to rebuild apk/aab on sequential builds, Unity will perform a copy instead now. Our tests show that sequential build times improved by 50%, for ex., dropping from 12 seconds to 5 seconds. (1361602)</p></li>
<li><p>Android: Workaround a problem where using logcat would leak pipes on OSX. The underlying problem seems to be with C# Process class, where if you redirect streams and dispose process, the pipes would remain opened. This will be investigated separatly. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-adb-functionality-leaks-a-pipe-causes-too-many-open-files-error">1303618</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Animation: Fixed an issue where an assert was triggered upon rebuilding an animation legacy component. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assertion-failed-on-expression-m-curves-when-playing-animation-after-reenabling-object">1330001</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Asset Bundles: Improved performance of Asset Bundle building when many bundles exist. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/building-process-of-the-assetbundles-is-slow-when-the-file-count-is-huge">1358059</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where MonoScripts in plugins that were dependent on plugins in other folders could fail to import when reimporting all assets. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mono-scripts-in-dlls-fail-to-import-when-reimporting-all-assets">1345854</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Asset Pipeline: Fixed exception that Rider would catch when Disposing instances of the ArtifactInfo class. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/artifactinfo-dot-internal-destroy-exception-thrown-when-in-play-mode-while-using-rider-debugger">1359723</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Asset Pipeline: Improved opening time of Import Activity Window. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/import-activity-window-takes-long-time-to-open">1343709</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Audio: Fixed exposing multiple send levels in the audio mixer not working correctly. Note: previously created mixers with exposed send levels will cause a warning to be logged on editor startup and the send levels will have to be re-exposed. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/audio-mixer-unable-to-expose-other-send-level-parameters-when-one-is-already-exposed">1285638</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Editor: Fixed windows editor sometimes getting into a "script assemblies are locked" state after invoking a modal dialog from a C# script. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/windows-asemblies-get-locked-when-trying-to-recompile-after-opening-and-closing-openfolderpanel-window">1367358</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Graphics: Fixed a crash in ray tracing shaders when different ray payload structures are used throughout shaders that are used in a ray tracing dispatch. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dxr-crash-after-domain-reload-after-changing-which-shader-pass-to-use-for-raytracing-shader">1351293</a>)</p></li>
