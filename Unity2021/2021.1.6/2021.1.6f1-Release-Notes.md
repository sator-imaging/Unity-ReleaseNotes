*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed for crash that could occur when downloading assets from cache server. (1319521)
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Initialise Sprite Vertex Data during import to fix uninitialised memory causing non-deterministic imports. (1244086)
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Objects loaded during import in initial script refresh, are now unloaded. ([1296506](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-scriptableobject-serializefield-value-set-to-default-during-the-first-import))
    
*   Build Pipeline: Make build fail faster when strict mode build option is used. ([1191481](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/build-callbacks-build-is-not-failing-when-buildfailedexception-is-thrown-in-the-postprocessscene-callback))

*   Graphics: A CopyDepth pass was previously included which allowed users script access to \_CameraDepthTarget but this has been removed on the metal GPU families that use Tile-based renderers (iOS, Silicon-GPU), fixing the performance decrease that this was causing. ([1298799](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-copydepth-pass-is-present-in-the-legacy-deferred-render-pipeline-and-results-in-extra-render-target-memory-and-gpu-time))

([1321661](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-unable-to-combine-the-last-input-character-in-text-input-field-when-character-limit-exists))

*   Prefabs: Instantiating, duplicating or updating prefabs no longer disables and re-enables the whole hierarchy, just the prefab instance. ([1269686](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/duplicating-a-prefab-instance-in-the-scene-will-cause-instances-of-the-same-prefab-to-be-disabled-and-re-enabled))
    
*   Profiler: On Mac, restoring defaults in the Profiler modules dropdown list now closes the dropdown list. ([1323673](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/profiler-order-of-modules-fails-to-reset-on-using-the-restore-defaults-option-from-the-profiler))
    
*   Serialization: Fixed SerializedProperty::arraySize when multiple objects are selected and the array has been resized. ([1327027](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/invalidoperationexception-is-thrown-when-attempting-to-delete-a-color-element-from-multi-selected-arrays))
