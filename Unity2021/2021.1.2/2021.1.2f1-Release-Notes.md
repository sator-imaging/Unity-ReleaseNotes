*   Scripting: CompiliationPipeline.GetAssemblies will now correctly include Roslyn analyzers in ScriptCompilerOptions.
    
*   XR: Removed "Preview" text from UI display element.
    

### API Changes

*   Graphics: Added: New API functions with no side effects in DynamicResolutionHandler, to retrieve resolved drs scale and to apply DRS on a size.
