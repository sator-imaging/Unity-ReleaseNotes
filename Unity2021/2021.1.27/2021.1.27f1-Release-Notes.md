### Improvements

*   Scripting: Add GameObject link to Warning message: "SendMessage cannot be called during Awake, CheckConsistency, or OnValidate.".

### API Changes

*   Shadergraph: Added: ShaderGraph animated preview framerate throttle.
    
*   URP: Added: Support for controlling Volume Framework Update Frequency in UI on Cameras and URP Asset as well as through scripting.
    

### Changes

*   URP: Opacity as Density blending feature for Terrain Lit Shader is now disabled when the Terrain has more than four Terrain Layers. This is now similar to the Height-blend feature for the Terrain Lit Shader.
