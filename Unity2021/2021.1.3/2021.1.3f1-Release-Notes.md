<ul>
<li><p>Audio: Don't shut down audio output device in edit mode when DSPGraph is running. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dspgraph-audio-stops-after-60-seconds-when-playing-in-the-editor-mode">1310050</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>DX12: Fixed black screen that would show when using a non-native resolution in fullscreen. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dx12-nothing-is-being-rendered-when-using-alt-plus-enter-to-maximize-a-resized-windowed-player">1318666</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Editor: Fixed Material Editor large thumbnails not showing up correctly for material texture properties when the texture type is Texture2DArray or Texture3D. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-texture-is-not-displayed-in-texture-selector-preview-icon-when-texture-type-is-2d-array-and-3d">1288995</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Editor: Fixed Texture3DPreview InfoString incorrectly displaying: Texture dimensions as Z-Y-Z instead of X-Y-Z &amp; very small resolutions. (1321095)</p></li>
<li><p>Graphics: Fixed DrawProcedural reporting incorrect triangle counts to FrameStats.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphics: Fixed performance issue when loading textures direct to GPU memory from LZ4 compressed packages. (1307820)</p></li>
<li><p>IL2CPP: Fixed possible ArgumentException when converting a call to a type that implements multiple variations of the same generic interface. (1319313)</p></li>
<li><p>IL2CPP: Redist dlls copied from MSVC &amp; Windows SDK for Windows Games platforms. (1299856)</p></li>

They will now only occur when switching back-and-forth between a built-in microphone and a Bluetooth microphone. When using "Prepare iOS for Recording", most projects will also want to set "Force iOS Speakers when Recording".

(<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/resigning-unity-built-macos-app-results-in-code-signature-data-out-of-place-out-of-place-error">1324168</a>)</p></li>
