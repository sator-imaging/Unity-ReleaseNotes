### Fixes

*   Audio: Don't shut down audio output device in edit mode when DSPGraph is running. ([1310050](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dspgraph-audio-stops-after-60-seconds-when-playing-in-the-editor-mode))
    
*   DX12: Fixed black screen that would show when using a non-native resolution in fullscreen. ([1318666](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dx12-nothing-is-being-rendered-when-using-alt-plus-enter-to-maximize-a-resized-windowed-player))
    
*   Editor: Fixed Material Editor large thumbnails not showing up correctly for material texture properties when the texture type is Texture2DArray or Texture3D. ([1288995](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-texture-is-not-displayed-in-texture-selector-preview-icon-when-texture-type-is-2d-array-and-3d))
    
*   Editor: Fixed Texture3DPreview InfoString incorrectly displaying: Texture dimensions as Z-Y-Z instead of X-Y-Z & very small resolutions. (1321095)
    
*   Graphics: Fixed DrawProcedural reporting incorrect triangle counts to FrameStats.
    
*   Graphics: Fixed performance issue when loading textures direct to GPU memory from LZ4 compressed packages. (1307820)
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed possible ArgumentException when converting a call to a type that implements multiple variations of the same generic interface. (1319313)
    
*   IL2CPP: Redist dlls copied from MSVC & Windows SDK for Windows Games platforms. (1299856)
    
*   iOS: Fixed a performance issue where Microphone.Start would cause CPU spikes on iOS. If the user selects the player setting "Prepare iOS for Recording", these spikes have been eliminated. They will now only occur when switching back-and-forth between a built-in microphone and a Bluetooth microphone. When using "Prepare iOS for Recording", most projects will also want to set "Force iOS Speakers when Recording". ([1281833](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mobile-microphone-dot-start-method-invocation-causes-200-800ms-spikes))
    
*   iOS: Leaderboards now return the non deprecated player ID on appropriate OS versions. ([1312882](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-social-api-score-dot-userid-returns-a-legacy-id-from-gamecenter))
    
*   Linux: Install sysroot packages automatically only when Linux IL2CPP is present. (1325982)
    
*   macOS: Fixed failing to resign binaries after Unity has signed them with error: "file not in an order that can be processed (code signature data out of place):". ([1324168](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/resigning-unity-built-macos-app-results-in-code-signature-data-out-of-place-out-of-place-error))
    
*   macOS: Fixed Windows and Linux native plugins getting included into the generated Xcode project. ([1321049](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/xcode-macos-copyplugins-phase-in-xcode-build-phases-includes-dll-files))
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue where adding packages from a registry which returned invalid publish dates would fail. ([1318975](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/packages-cannot-be-added-from-a-registry-that-returns-invalid-publish-dates-windows-only))
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue where the `UnityEditor.PackageManager.Client.SearchAll` method would result in a connection error despite using `offlineMode = true`. ([1319585](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/packagemanager-dot-client-dot-searchall-offlinemode-true-returns-an-error-if-user-offline))
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue which could sometimes cause package resolution errors due to `EMFILE` errors in projects with a large number of packaged assets.
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue which could sometimes lead to missing files in successfully resolved packages in projects with a large number of packaged assets.
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue which prevented starting `UnityPackageManager.exe` on Windows when its path contained non-ANSI Unicode characters. ([1317244](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-wont-start-with-unicode-install-path))

*   Scene/Game View: Fixed Physics Debugger not selecting collider debug volumes first when clicking. ([1309768](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mouse-selection-in-physics-debugger-prioritizes-mesh-gameobjects-over-gameobjects-with-colliders))
    
*   XR: Fixed depth buffer sharing support. ([1242142](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shared-depth-buffer-not-populated-properly-breaking-wmr-reprojection))
    
*   XR: \[Lumin\] : Fixed some improper temp string usage that was causing the allocator to spam the system logs. (1284830)
