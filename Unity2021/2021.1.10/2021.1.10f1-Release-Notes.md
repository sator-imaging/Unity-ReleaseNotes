### Improvements

*   IL2CPP: Corrected provide the source file hash so that a managed debugger can determine when a source file has changed and provide a proper warning.

### API Changes

*   Services: Changed: On some platforms we strip out the Analytics modules completely. so any user code that references anything from Analytics will not compile on these platforms. this PR is to update the documentation informing users of the need to #ifdef this code out for this situation.
