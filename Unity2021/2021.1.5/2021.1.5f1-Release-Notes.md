### Fixes

*   Android: Fixed freeze when using blend shapes with compute skinning on some devices with Mali G78 GPU. ([1298373](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/app-freezes-on-huawei-mate-40-pro-while-playing-multiple-blend-tree-animations))
    
*   Animation: Fixed StateMachineBehaviour callback been called when playable is paused. ([1321298](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/onstateenter-slash-onstateexit-is-called-repeatedly-when-an-animatorcontrollerplayable-is-paused-on-the-first-or-last-frame-of-a-state))
    
*   Asset Import: Texture Importer no longer secretly defaults values to a negative. ([1204566](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/textureimporter-dot-wrapmode-returns-1-when-textures-wrap-mode-is-not-changed))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: The main object name is now updated as appropriate when moving/renaming a file. ([1210886](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefab-file-contents-do-not-update-when-it-is-renamed))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Unity version no longer written to serialized artifact files generated during asset importing. This was causing inconsistency import result across Unity versions. For existing projects, you must either do a "Reimport All" or delete the library folder for this fix to take effect. ([1310981](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/generated-inconsistent-result-warning-when-reimporting-single-asset))
    
*   Burst: Broken link restored for known issues with debugging and profiling.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a bug where the multi-CPU dispatcher (used for player builds targetting multiple CPU architectures) could end up generating invalid instructions.
    
*   Burst: Fixed an issue where PDB debug information for instance methods that also used struct return were incorrect.
    
*   Burst: When generating Line Table only debug information, an unreachable could occur due to a missing check.
    
*   Editor: Fixed files in Packages folder getting moved to Assets when dragging in the Project Browser. ([1319052](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/file-gets-moved-to-the-asset-folder-when-trying-to-move-it-elsewhere-within-a-custom-package))
    
*   Editor: Removed blue line appearing in Editor debug build Inspector windows while hovering between components and without a dragging action. (1323348)
    
*   Graphics: Fixed a crash when loading old asset bundles that contain shaders compiled with Vulkan. ([1308947](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-vk-decompressshader-when-loading-an-assetbundle-with-assetbundle-dot-loadfromfile-and-using-vulkan-graphics-api))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed allocations errors with EncodeNativeArrayToEXR/PNG/JPG. (1315246)
    
*   Kernel: Atomic 64-bit Load/Store on Win32/UWP x86 fixed (Reads and writes to 64-bit values are not guaranteed to be atomic on 32-bit Windows).
    
*   Kernel: Stop using recently deprecated timer native functions on Mac/iOS/tvOS and replace with current official recommendation.
    
*   Linux: Fixed Mouse.position showing coordinates in the window space the mouse was over, instead of the game view. ([1318271](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-input-system-editor-does-not-return-correct-mouse-position-values-when-using-position-dot-readvalue))
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue where Git dependencies using annotated tags for revisions could not be resolved. ([1325920](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/package-resolution-error-when-using-a-git-dependency-referencing-an-annotated-tag-in-its-git-url))
    
*   Particles: Removed 2 decimal point restriction from Duration property. ([1319730](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particle-system-duration-propertys-value-has-double-precision))
    
*   Physics: Ensure that when using 'Physics2D.Distance()' where one of the colliders is an EdgeCollider2D with an adjacent start/end point, that the correct distance points and normal are calculated. ([1321270](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/edgecollider2d-adjacent-endpoints-result-in-inverted-separation-normals-when-using-collider2d-dot-distance))
    
*   Physics: Fixed an issue with setting Surface Penetration to 0 on objects that were authored on one scale but used with another. This would manifest itself as incorrect particle separation behavior. ([1319488](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cloth-is-broken-when-parent-gameobject-scale-is-lower-than-1-and-surface-penetration-constraints-are-set-0))

*   Scripting: Assembly Version Validation can now be enabled or disabled for the editor when the project is setup to run on IL2CPP backend. ([1307810](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assembly-version-validation-disabled-when-using-il2cpp-scripting-backend))
    
*   Scripting: Fixed file parameter with spaces not showing up properly in some cases where there is a compilation error. ([1318667](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/file-parameter-has-incorrect-value-in-compilermessage-when-the-path-has-spaces))

*   UI Toolkit: Fixed clipping of the content of a mask element whose size is zero. ([1320182](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/uir-overflow-hidden-does-not-work-when-visualelements-width-or-height-is-less-than-1-percent))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed not allowing text changes on text input field when they are disabled. ([1286143](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/packages-search-results-are-not-updated-when-changing-search-box-value-during-the-packages-refresh))
