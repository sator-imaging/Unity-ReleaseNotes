### Fixes
<ul>
<li><p>Android: Fixed freeze when using blend shapes with compute skinning on some devices with Mali G78 GPU. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/app-freezes-on-huawei-mate-40-pro-while-playing-multiple-blend-tree-animations">1298373</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Animation: Fixed StateMachineBehaviour callback been called when playable is paused. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/onstateenter-slash-onstateexit-is-called-repeatedly-when-an-animatorcontrollerplayable-is-paused-on-the-first-or-last-frame-of-a-state">1321298</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Asset Import: Texture Importer no longer secretly defaults values to a negative. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/textureimporter-dot-wrapmode-returns-1-when-textures-wrap-mode-is-not-changed">1204566</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Asset Pipeline: The main object name is now updated as appropriate when moving/renaming a file. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefab-file-contents-do-not-update-when-it-is-renamed">1210886</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Asset Pipeline: Unity version no longer written to serialized artifact files generated during asset importing. This was causing inconsistency import result across Unity versions. For existing projects, you must either do a "Reimport All" or delete the library folder for this fix to take effect. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/generated-inconsistent-result-warning-when-reimporting-single-asset">1310981</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Burst: Broken link restored for known issues with debugging and profiling.</p></li>
<li><p>Burst: Fixed a bug where the multi-CPU dispatcher (used for player builds targetting multiple CPU architectures) could end up generating invalid instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>Burst: Fixed an issue where PDB debug information for instance methods that also used struct return were incorrect.</p></li>
<li><p>Burst: When generating Line Table only debug information, an unreachable could occur due to a missing check.</p></li>
<li><p>Editor: Fixed files in Packages folder getting moved to Assets when dragging in the Project Browser. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/file-gets-moved-to-the-asset-folder-when-trying-to-move-it-elsewhere-within-a-custom-package">1319052</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Editor: Removed blue line appearing in Editor debug build Inspector windows while hovering between components and without a dragging action. (1323348)</p></li>
<li><p>Graphics: Fixed a crash when loading old asset bundles that contain shaders compiled with Vulkan. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-vk-decompressshader-when-loading-an-assetbundle-with-assetbundle-dot-loadfromfile-and-using-vulkan-graphics-api">1308947</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Kernel: Atomic 64-bit Load/Store on Win32/UWP x86 fixed (Reads and writes to 64-bit values are not guaranteed to be atomic on 32-bit Windows).</p></li>
<li><p>Kernel: Stop using recently deprecated timer native functions on Mac/iOS/tvOS and replace with current official recommendation.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux: Fixed Mouse.position showing coordinates in the window space the mouse was over, instead of the game view. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-input-system-editor-does-not-return-correct-mouse-position-values-when-using-position-dot-readvalue">1318271</a>)</p></li>
