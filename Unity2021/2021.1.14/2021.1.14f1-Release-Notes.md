## 2021.1.14f1 Release Notes


### Features
<ul>
<li><p>Mobile: Adaptive view distance scaler - A new scaler to change the Camera.main view distance automatically.</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile: Boost mode - Boost CPU and GPU for short periods of time.</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile: Cluster info - Request cluster info to have details which and how many cores are available on the device.</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile: Feature API - Check which Adaptive Performance feature is available on the current platform.</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile: Scaler profiles - Easily define and change Adaptive Performance Scalers with predefined profiles.</p></li>
</ul>

### API Changes
<ul>
<li><p>Graphics: Added: Added SpeedTree8MaterialUpgrader, which provides utilities for upgrading and importing SpeedTree 8 assets to scriptable render pipelines.</p></li>
<li><p>HDRP: Added: Added SpeedTree8MaterialUpgrader, which provides utilities for upgrading and importing SpeedTree 8 assets to scriptable render pipelines.</p></li>
<li><p>Shadergraph: Added: Added an HLSL file implementing a version of the Unity core LODDitheringTransition function which can be used in a Shader Graph</p></li>
<li><p>Shadergraph: Added: Added subshadergraphs for SpeedTree 8 shadergraph support: SpeedTree8Wind, SpeedTree8ColorAlpha, SpeedTree8Billboard.</p></li>
<li><p>URP: Added: Added a SpeedTree 8 Shader Graph but did not set it as the default when importing or upgrading Speed Tree 8 assets. Because URP doesn't yet support per-material culling, this Shader Graph does not yet behave in the same way as the existing handwritten SpeedTree 8 shader for URP.</p></li>
</ul>
