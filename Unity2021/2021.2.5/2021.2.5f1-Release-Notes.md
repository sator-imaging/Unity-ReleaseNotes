### Improvements

*   Editor: Added an Information Entry when the player data is rebuilt with 'Development' checkbox off. The message will be 'Rebuilding Data files because BuildOptions.Development is not set.' (1364982)

### Fixes

*   Android: Fixed an issue where Resource.Load did not work when running universal.apk were created from AAB which was built with Split Application Binary option that was enabled. Note: In universal.apk, Bundletool includes only install-time delivered asset packs, so resource loading can still fail if Unity creates fast-follow delivered core data asset pack. (1363907)

*   Input System: Fixe an issue where any unhandled exception in `InputManager.OnUpdate` failed latter updates with `InvalidOperationException: Already have an event buffer set! Was OnUpdate() called recursively?`. Instead the system will try to handle the exception and recover into a working state.
    
*   Input System: Fixed "Default constructor not found for type UnityEngine.InputSystem.iOS.LowLevel.iOSStepCounter" any other potential exceptions due to classes, methods, fields and properties being stripped when managed stripping setting set to medium or high.

*   Input System: Fixed an issue where explicitly switching to an already active control scheme and device set for `PlayerInput` would cancel event callbacks for no reason when the control scheme switch would have no practical effect. This fix detects and skips device unpairing and re-pairing if the switch is detected to not be a change to scheme or devices. ([1342297](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-button-clicks-are-missed-when-using-switchcurrentcontrolscheme-inside-of-onmousedown))

([1354098](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-errors-are-thrown-when-disconnecting-controller-while-holding-a-button-with-press-and-release-set-up-separately))
    
*   Input System: Fixed an issue where resetting an action via `InputAction.Reset()` while being in disabled state would prevent the action from being enabled again. ([1370732](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/new-input-system-disable-reset-enable-makes-controls-being-disabled-forever))
    
*   Input System: Fixed current being `null` for sensors (`Accelerometer.current`, others). ([1371204](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/accelerometer-not-working-when-using-input-system-1-dot-1-1))
    
*   Input System: Fixed input action for Android gamepad's right stick will be correctly invoked when only the Y-axis is changing. ([1308637](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-input-system-right-analog-stick-tracking-is-erratic-when-using-a-gamepad-connected-to-an-android-device))
    
*   Input System: Fixed `action.ReadValue` and others returning invalid data when used from `FixedUpdate` or early update when running in play mode in the editor. ([1368559](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/enter-key-is-not-registered-when-using-waspressedthisframe-with-input-system-1-dot-1-1))
    
*   Input System: Generic gamepad short display button names where incorrectly mapped on Switch (`A` instead of `B`, etc).
    
*   Profiler: Fixed a crash when exiting Unity Editor related to UnsafeUtility.Malloc usage. (1377694)
    
*   Serialization: Fixed missed invocations of ISerializationCallbackReceiver.OnAfterDeserialization and asserts arising when that interface is implemented on structs inside a MonoBehaviour or ScriptableObject class, along with the presence of SerializeReference fields. ([1372710](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assertion-failed-error-is-thrown-when-calling-resources-dot-loadall-together-with-linq-expressions))
    
*   Shadergraph: Fixed a ShaderGraph warning when connecting a node using Object Space BiTangent to the vertex stage. ([1361512](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-graph-cross-implicit-truncation-of-vector-type-errors-are-thrown-when-connecting-transform-node-to-vertex-block))
    
*   Shadergraph: Fixed a usability issue where in some cases searcher would suggest one collapsed category of results that user would have to manually expand anyway.
    
*   Shadergraph: Fixed an issue that caused exceptions to be thrown when using the up/down arrow keys with search list focused. ([1358016](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shadergraph-searcher-if-a-user-presses-the-up-or-down-arrow-keys-while-searching-for-nodes-in-sg-an-exception-occurs))
    
*   Shadergraph: Fixed an issue that caused incorrect search results with non whitespaced queries for nodes with spaces in their name and for subgraphs. (1359158)
    
*   Shadergraph: Fixed an issue that caused search results to not be visible sometimes in the searcher window. (1366061)
    
*   Shadergraph: Fixed an issue that caused some searcher items to be irreversibly collapsed due to expand icon disappearing on collapsing those items.
    
*   Shaders: Prevent shader cache from growing infinitely. Shader cache is now organized into per asset folders. ([1339314](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-cache-grows-indefinitely))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where the element under pointer was not updated when pointer position varied very slowly (subpixel amounts on each update). ([1356041](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/buttons-are-not-registering-mouse-when-the-mouse-is-slowly-moved-over-it))
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Fixed a generated Visual Studio project issue when building to Universal Windows Platform with Visual Studio 2022. ([1378086](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unity-produces-visual-studio-project-that-by-default-doesnt-build-when-using-visual-studio-2022))

*   URP: Fixed an issue where the Convert Renderering Settings would cause a freeze. ([1353885](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-builtin-to-urp-render-pipeline-converter-freezes-the-editor-when-converting-rendering-settings))

*   WebGL: Fixed AudioSource.loop property when using AudioSource.PlayScheduled() and AudioSource.PlayDelayed(). ([1337312](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/audio-is-not-looping-when-using-playscheduled-in-webgl-build))

*   Windows: UnityCrashHandler.exe will no longer inherit all Windows handles from the editor/player when launched, which should eliminate some problems with it causing files to be locked unnecessarily.
