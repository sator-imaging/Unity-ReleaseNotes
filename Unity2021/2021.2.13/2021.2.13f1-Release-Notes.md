## 2021.2.13f1 Release Notes


### Improvements
<ul>
<li><p>Scripting: Improved AssemblyUpdater to not try to connect to VCS unless there assemblies under VCS that needs updating. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/perforce-unnecessary-checkout-for-dll-files-when-reimporting-them-in-the-editor">1353761</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Scripting: Improved invalid ApiUpdater configs detection.</p></li>
<li><p>UI Toolkit: Refactored UI Builder's asset modification processor's OnWillSaveAssets() callback to save changes automatically on the Save and Save Project global commands.</p></li>
<li><p>UI Toolkit: Removed the Cmd+S handler code since it's not need to handle that separately anymore. Also removed the associated (and unused) OnSaveDocument callback.</p></li>
<li><p>UI Toolkit: Save operation is properly skipped on the Duplicate command which, unfortunately, also uses the (same) asset modification processor callback.</p></li>
</ul>
