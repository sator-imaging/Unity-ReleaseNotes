### Improvements

*   Scripting: Improved AssemblyUpdater to not try to connect to VCS unless there assemblies under VCS that needs updating. ([1353761](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/perforce-unnecessary-checkout-for-dll-files-when-reimporting-them-in-the-editor))
    
*   Scripting: Improved invalid ApiUpdater configs detection.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Refactored UI Builder's asset modification processor's OnWillSaveAssets() callback to save changes automatically on the Save and Save Project global commands.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Removed the Cmd+S handler code since it's not need to handle that separately anymore. Also removed the associated (and unused) OnSaveDocument callback.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Save operation is properly skipped on the Duplicate command which, unfortunately, also uses the (same) asset modification processor callback.
    

### API Changes

*   Shaders: Added: Pass.CompileVariant API now has an option to generate shader data for use by external tools. ([1371640](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vulkan-shaderdata-dot-pass-dot-compilevariant-function-compile-data-in-the-smol-v-format-when-using-vulkan))
