### Features

*   Android: Adding support for Multi-window environments in Android applications. This include Split Screen, popup windows and freeform windowing.

### Improvements

*   2D: Improved performance of RuleTile caching
    
*   Android: Added boot-config/command-line switch "platform-android-cpucapacity-threshold" that can be used to specify which CPU cores are treated as big cores. The cpu capacity is a value in the range between 0 and 1024. A capacity value of 870 yields the same behavior as before the fix for case 1349057.
    
*   Asset Import: Improved loading performances of import settings for models with a lot of animation clips. ([1338096](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inspector-import-settings-are-slow-to-load-when-selecting-a-model-with-a-lot-of-animations))
    
*   Editor: UnityEvent callbacks can be reordered
    

### API Changes

*   Asset Bundles: Added: Added public API to specify the amount of memory reserved for the shared AssetBundle loading cache.
    
*   Asset Bundles: Added: Adding new API DownloadHandlerAssetBundle.autoLoadAssetBundle for loading AssetBundles asynchronously from DownloadHandlerAssetBundle.
    
*   XR: Added: Added IUnityGraphicsVulkanV2 plugin interface to add support for chaining vulkan initialization intercepts. (1349908)
    

### Changes

*   2D: Allow non-public fields with the SerializeField attribute as custom fields for RuleTile
    
*   Package: com.unity.purchasing updated to 3.2.3. Please refer to the package changelog online here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.purchasing@3.2/changelog/CHANGELOG.html
    
*   XR: The Oculus XR Plugin package has been updated to 1.10.0.
    
*   XR: Unity 2020 LTS will be the last version of the editor which supports Magic Leap 1 Developers can continue to build for Magic Leap 1 using Unity 2020 LTS or 2019 LTS.
    

### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed an exception when adding a new Rule when no Rule was selected.
    
*   2D: Fixed an issue where clear buffer was executed out of order. ([1292637](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/debug-lines-are-not-drawn-inside-the-screen-when-using-pixel-perfect-camera-component))
    
*   2D: Fixed an issue where IKManager2D did not detect classes inheritted from Solver2D. (1343260)

*   Android: Fixed an issue where a user would have stale touches present after touching the screen with multiple fingers.

These were add in SystemInfo for macOS and Linux, and to SystemInfo in Runtime/Misc used by WebGL and MetroPlayer.
