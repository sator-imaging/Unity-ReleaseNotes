### Features

*   Android: Added more complete support for running Android apps on the Chrome OS platform. These changes enable building and running Android on x86 and x86-64 CPUs, now officially supported on Chrome OS devices. These changes also include input-related improvements for Chrome OS.
    
*   Shaders: Added support for specifying package requirements for SubShaders and Passes to ShaderLab.
    
*   Version Control: - Plastic: Added support for inviting other members. This option is available from the gear / settings icon.  
    
    *   Plastic: Added support for signing in with Cloud Edition. This is available during the onboarding screen if you have never signed in.  
        
    *   Plastic: Added support for turning off Plastic in their project. This option removes the Plastic metadata from your directory. This option is available under Assets > Plastic SCM > Turn off Plastic SCM  
        
    *   Plastic: Added notification on the Plastic SCM tab title to indicate incoming changes. Users will no longer need to have the Plastic SCM window visible to know there are incoming changes.  
        
    *   Plastic: Auto configuration of SSO  
        
    *   Plastic: Added date column in incoming changes

### Improvements

*   Android: Add property PlayerSettings.Android.optimizedFramePacing API ([1329232](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/optimized-frame-pacing-option-is-not-available-when-referencing-it-via-android-player-settings-in-a-script))
    
*   Android: Bump Android Logcat package to 1.2.3

*   Graphics: VFX : Optimization while sending event to a VisualEffect by script
    
*   iOS: Improve logging in iOS automation: clarify existing log messages and add new ones.

*   Package: Update Addressables to 1.18.9 and SBP to 1.19.0
    
*   Physics: Overhauled the articulation gizmos to have better functionality and to better match other Unity gizmos' style
    
*   Version Control: - Stability and performance improvements
    
*   WebGL: Improved network bandwidth usage of VideoPlayer.Stop() API in WebGL builds by stopping the video stream from downloading further. (1348468)
    

### API Changes

*   Asset Pipeline: Added: Added AssetDatabase.SaveAssetIfDirty() to save individual assets if required.
    
*   Services: Added: Added new com.unity.services.core package that is used for common behaviour of Game Service packages
    

### Changes

*   2D: Tile.StartUp is called after Tilemap is loaded instead of on the first Update after Tilemap is loaded. (1327583)
    
*   iOS: Use Shell.ExecuteProgramAndGetStdout for process handling in iOS automation code
    
*   Shadergraph: Only ShaderGraph keywords count towards the shader permutation variant limit, SubGraph keywords do not.
    
*   Version Control: ### Changed  
    
    *   Updating license to better conform with expected customer usage.  
        
    *   Updated documentation file to meet standards.  
        
    *   Updated third-party usage.  
        
    *   No longer requires downloading of the full Plastic client. Basic features will work without additional installation. Features that require the full Plastic client will allow download and install as needed.  
        
    *   Usability improvements around checking in code  
        
    *   Improved update workspace tab UX  
        
    *   Plastic SCM context menu is now available even if the Plastic SCM window is closed
*   XR: Updated XR Legacy Input Helpers to 2.1.8.
