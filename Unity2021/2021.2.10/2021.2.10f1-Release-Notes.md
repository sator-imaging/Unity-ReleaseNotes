*   Burst: Fixed a bug where the compiler would reject a `try`/`finally` statement if it was the first thing in a method.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a compiler miscompile if you load a `static readonly v128` and pass it straight to a function as an argument.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a null-derefence that could occur if you used `UnsafeUtility.IsUnmanaged` in a `static readonly` constructor.
    
*   Burst: Fixed a Unity 2021.2 and newer bug that manifested with UWP builds to use the right `unityaot` folder.
