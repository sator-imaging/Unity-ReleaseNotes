## Changes



*   GI: Disabled unused Xbox360 solver data generation.
*   Input: Changed Input.GetJoystickNames() on Windows to always match names to joystick numbers, similar to most other platforms (in 4.6.4 too).
*   iOS: Default scripting backend is set to IL2CPP on iOS.
*   Terrain: Only textures with Repeat wrap mode can be used as terrain splat textures now.
*   Terrain: Removed 'Override Smoothness' option from terrain settings. A new per-splat smoothness property is available when the splat texture has no alpha channel.
