## Improvements



*   Android: Audio - Enabled OpenSL for GearVR.
*   iOS/IL2CPP: Load embedded resource files as memory mapped read-only files so that they do not contribute to memory pressure.
*   iOS/IL2CPP: Lower memory used by IL2CPP executables at runtime by removing unused overhead from memory profiling.
*   Xbox One: Unity is now build with the June 2015 XDK. You must have the June 2015 XDK installed on your PC and use the matching or later recovery.
