## Improvements

<ul>
<li>Android: Audio - Enabled OpenSL for GearVR.</li>
<li>iOS/IL2CPP: Load embedded resource files as memory mapped read-only files so that they do not contribute to memory pressure.</li>
<li>iOS/IL2CPP: Lower memory used by IL2CPP executables at runtime by removing unused overhead from memory profiling.</li>
<li>Xbox One: Unity is now build with the June 2015 XDK.  You must have the June 2015 XDK installed on your PC and use the matching or later recovery.</li>
</ul>
