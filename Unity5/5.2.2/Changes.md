# Unity 5.2.2

https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-5.2.2

## Changes



*   Installers: Updated the EULA.
*   Substance: Removed support for Unity 3.x metafiles for SBSAR files. The associated .meta files should be manually deleted and the materials recreated after reimporting the SBSAR assets.
*   Visual Studio Integration: No longer open unity documentation html in visual studio when opening it, since VSTU supports doc searching out of the box.
*   VR: For Windows Oculus Development, the Oculus 0.7.0.0 runtime is required in order to run in VR mode. Future releases will also require this runtime going forward.
