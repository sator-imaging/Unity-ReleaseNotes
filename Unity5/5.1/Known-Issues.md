## Known Issues

<ul>
<li>Editor: Renaming file-locked assets may lead to lost data.</li>
<li>On Windows, using a proxy server will crash Unity when trying to access the Asset Store.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Setting AnimatorState.speed to 0 doesnâ€™t pause the animation as expected.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Switching runtime AnimatorState.speed from positive to negative break animation continuity.</li>
<li>Mecanim: Copy-Pasting StateMachines will not copy the Transitions inside of them.</li>
<li>Unity VR 
<ul>
<li>Oculus 0.6 runtime is required</li>
<li>Mac and Gear VR support coming in 5.1.0 patch 1</li>
<li>At this time if you wish to continue using Legacy Oculus plugins in your project we recommend you keep the 'Virtual Reality Supported' checkbox unchecked.  In a later release this checkbox will have no impact if a legacy plugin is present.</li>
<li>VRSettings.renderScale is non-functional, fixed in 5.1.0 patch 1</li>
<li>Apps that use linear lighting won't render.  Recommended to use gamma for now.</li>
<li>If your app won't launch in VR mode, use command line option "-vrmode oculus"</li>
<li>UI: Screen Space - Overlay not supported.  Recommended to use Screen Space - Camera or World Space.  "Scale With Screen Size" is recommended so UI looks the same on Gear VR.</li>
<li>Toggling VRSettings.loadedDevice at runtime crashes, fixed in 5.1.0 patch 1</li>
</ul></li>
