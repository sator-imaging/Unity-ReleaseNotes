https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-5.4.4

## Improvements

<ul>
<li>Graphics: Added support for feature level 11.1 on D3D11/D3D12. This brings native support for RGB565, ARGB4444 and ARGB1555 RenderTexture formats. (757055)</li>
<li>Lighting: Added more information to the additive loading error message e.g. “The loaded level has a different lightmaps mode than the current one. Current: Directional. Loaded: Directional Specular. Will use: Directional.”</li>
<li>MacOS/iOS/tvOS: Allow developers to use Xcode's manual signing paradigm by specifying a provisioning profile in Player Settings.</li>
<li>Shaders: Increased the number of allowed shader keywords to 256 (up from 128). Optimized related parts of the code, so it's often actually faster now.</li>
<li>VR: Updated Oculus to version 1.10. </li>
</ul>
