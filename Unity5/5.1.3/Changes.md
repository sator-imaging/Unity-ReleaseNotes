## Changes



*   BlackBerry: SystemInfo.deviceModel now returns a useful model string value instead of a hexadecimal number.
*   Samsung TV: Users are now able to set the system language via SamsungTV.SetSystemLanguage. Users will need to fetch the system language via Samsung's GSP API plugin.
*   Windows Standalone: Player exe is no longer signed, icon and version modifications will no longer have digital signature errors.
*   Xbox One: Unity is now built using the June 2015 QFE 1 XDK. You will need to have this XDK installed on your PC and use the matching or a later recovery.
