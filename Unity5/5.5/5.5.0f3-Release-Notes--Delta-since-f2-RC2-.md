## 5.5.0f3 Release Notes (Delta since f2/RC2)


### Backwards Compatibility Breaking Changes
<ul>
<li>Audio: If previously using a Unity Hololens technical preview release with the Microsoft HRTF spatializer and the Audio Spatializer script component, said component now only controls room size properties. Distance-based attenuation is now set up in the AudioSource script component, so the Spatial Blend property needs to be set to 1.0 and the 3D Sound Settings need to be set appropriately.</li>
</ul>
