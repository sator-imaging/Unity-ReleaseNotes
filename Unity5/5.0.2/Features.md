# Unity 5.0.2
https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-5.0.2

## Features

<ul>
<li>XboxOne: The default update granularity used by XDK's makepkg tool has changed to File granularity rather than Chunk granularity.  There is now a setting to control this: 
<ul>
<li>Player Settings &gt; Xbox One &gt; Microsoft Xbox One Package Settings &gt; Update Granularity.  This property is set to File by default.  Chunk is recommended only for games that have already been released using the Chunk granularity, which was the default prior to this build.   </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
