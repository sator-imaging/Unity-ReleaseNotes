### Improvements

*   Editor: Added profiler markers around test setup, teardown, and execution.
    
*   Editor: Improved UTF documentation (DSTR-120).
    
*   Editor: Reduced the per-test overhead of running tests in the editor.

*   Editor: Reduced the time taken to rebuild the test tree and to scan for assets a test created but did not delete.
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue where using a Git URL with a revision and a package path in the wrong order would still clone the repository, introducing unnecessary delays before failing with an error.
    
*   Package Manager: Improved logging by adding logs for cache misses and tarball download steps.
    
*   Package Manager: Improved the error message when a Git dependency cannot be resolved because the path querystring and revision fragment are in the wrong order.
    
*   Package Manager: Increased the amount of information logged to upm.log at various levels.
    
*   Package Manager: Optimized Git package download times for repositories using submodules (with Git 2.28.0 or higher installed only).
    
*   Package Manager: Optimized Git package download times, most notably for repositories with a larger history.
    

### API Changes

### Fixes

*   Android: Fixed rendering artifacts when using HDR rendering with MSAA on sold Mali Bifrost GPUs. ([1303685](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-urp-opengles-only-renderqueue-transparent-gameobjects-are-rendered-if-opaque-texture-is-enabled-and-msaa-is-4x-or-8x))
