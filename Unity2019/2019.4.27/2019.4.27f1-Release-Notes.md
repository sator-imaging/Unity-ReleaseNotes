<li><p>Text: Fixed an issue where GetPathsToOSFonts() was not returning all system font files.</p></li>
<li><p>UI: Fixed a clipping issue with VisualElements that use the GroupTransform hint, the nested masking which is not supported in this version, would force the leaf GroupTransform element to fallback to rect clipping, but the assert presumed that it could not happen.
