### Fixes

*   2D: Use correct starting Z depth for IsometricZAsY Grids when calculating camera bounds for TilemapRenderer (1237963)
    
*   2D: \[Windows\] Unity crashes when packing big amount of atlases ([1219643](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/windows-unity-crashes-when-packing-big-amount-of-atlases))
    
*   Android: Fixed an issue where master sprite atlases did not use the specified ETC2 fallback format ([1175291](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-etc2-opengles2-when-etc2-fallback-is-set-to-32-bit-half-resolution-sprites-in-sprite-atlas-dont-use-the-fallback))
    
*   Animation: Fixed a bug where selected GameObjects are deleted when entering Play Mode and "Failed to unpersist" error is thrown ([1222757](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/selected-gameobjects-are-deleted-when-entering-play-mode-and-failed-to-unpersist-error-is-thrown))
    
*   Asset Import: Adding multiple MonoBehaviour scripts on the same GameObject using OnPostprocessModel during a ModelImporter import does not log uniqueness warning on new assets. It still does log the message on already imported assets because all references to it would be lost otherwise. (1176912)
    
*   Asset Import: Fixed an issue where files authored in earlier versions, which reference objects imported by scripted importers, might lose the link to those files (1189088)
    
*   Asset Import: Fixed an issue where upgrading a project to Asset Database v2 could throw 'unknown script' errors
    
*   Editor: Fixed an Editor issue on Windows where while in playmode and paused one or more CPUs would be utilized at 100%. ([1219619](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-uses-one-cpu-logical-processor-at-100-percent-while-the-game-is-paused))

*   GI: Fixed GI baking in batchmode when using Scriptable Render Pipelines. (1211448)
    
*   GI: Fixed the lightmapper sometimes getting stuck, especially on undo after moving instances or changing resolutions. ([1144403](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/plm-baking-stalls-after-disabling-slash-enabling-static-gameobject))

*   iOS: Delete LaunchImage folder when doing iOS build. (1240800)
    
*   Linux: Fixed Linux Editor's main window incorrectly scrolling the main window's contents when the mouse scrollwheel is used. ([1130242](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-using-mouse-wheel-scrolls-the-top-bar-of-editor-as-well))
