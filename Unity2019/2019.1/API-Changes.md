https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2019.1.0

## API Changes



*   2D: Added a new property TextureGenerationSettings.secondarySpriteTextures, which lets you assign secondary textures to the Sprite texture asset that is being generated.
    
*   2D: Added a new property TextureImporter.secondarySpriteTextures, which lets you assgin secondary textures to a texture asset imported as Sprite.
    
*   2D: Added a new struct UnityEngine.SecondarySpriteTexture, which encapsulates a Texture2D and its shader property name to give Sprite-based renderers access to a secondary texture, in addition to the main Sprite texture.

*   Android: Added AndroidJNI methods which use sbyte parameters or return sbyte values (1069247)
    
*   Android: Deprecated AndroidJNI methods which use byte parameters or return byte values (1069247)
    
*   Android: Removed public API for setting the JVM Max heap size

*   Editor: Added new API to detect & control async shader compilation better in the Editor.

*   Editor: Added `CompilationPipeline.compilationStarted` and `CompilationPipeline.compilationFinished` events for when compilation starts and finishes in the Editor.
    
*   Editor: Added `CompilationPipeline.GetAssemblyDefinitionFilePathFromAssemblyReference`, `CompilationPipeline.GetAssemblyDefinitionReferenceType`, `CompilationPipeline.GUIDToAssemblyDefinitionReferenceGUID`, and `CompilationPipeline.AssemblyDefinitionReferenceGUIDToGUID` APIs for dealing with Assembly Definition File references that can be either a GUID or assembly name.

*   Graphics: Added Graphics and CommandBuffer method overloads to allow blitting to and from a texture array in the corresponding blit methods.
    
*   Graphics: Added Texture2DArray property "allSlices". The "allSlices" property can be used instead of "-1" to indicate that all texture array slices should be bound for methods that support texture arrays.

*   GraphView: Added `Renamable` capability to `GraphElement`.
    
*   GraphView: `GraphView.GetElementByGuid()` now returns the first element with the given GUID, within all of GraphView, not just elements contained in layers.
    
*   Kernel: Added a central cache for `TypeTrees`.
    
*   Memory Profiler: Added `Dispose` functionality to the `PackedMemorySnapshot` class to prevent instances from locking the snapshot file for longer than necessary.
    
*   Memory Profiler: Added `UnityEditor.Profiling.Memory.Experimental.PackedMemorySnapshot.Convert` to handle conversion from a `MemoryProfiler.PackedMemorysnapshot` object to a `UnityEditor.Profiling.Memory.Experimental.PackedMemorySnapshot` file.

*   Terrain: Added new TerrainData APIs to modify Terrain Textures more easily.
    
    *   `TerrainData.CopyActiveRenderTextureToHeightmap`
    *   `TerrainData.CopyActiveRenderTextureToTexture` Use the two above functions to copy content of the active RT into Terrain Textures, and optionally delay CPU synchronization, for instance, when a mousemove event occurs in the middle of painting.
        
    *   `TerrainData.DirtyHeightmapRegion`
        
    *   `TerrainData.DirtyTextureRegion` Use these two functions instead of ones initially listed if the user directly changes the GPU resources through other means.
