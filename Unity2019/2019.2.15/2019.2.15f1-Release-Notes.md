### System Requirements Changes

#### Nothing changed.

### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed an issue where the Sprite Atlas stored hash changed when Atlas was built on a different machine. ([1186887](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sprite-atlas-stored-hash-changes-when-atlas-is-built-on-a-different-machine))
    
*   Android: Added gfx device command line arguments support in release builds. (1195061)

*   Animation: Removed requirement when generating avatar map that the root transform be the root of the game object's hierarchy as this is no longer required. ([1183581](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/animation-stream-binding-animationstream-handles-on-a-nested-animator-hierarchy-triggers-an-exception))

*   Desktop:
    
    *   OS: Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.12+, Ubuntu 12.04+, SteamOS+
    *   Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
    *   CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.
*   iOS player requires iOS 9.0 or higher.
    
*   Android: OS 4.1 or later; ARMv7 CPU with NEON support or Atom CPU; OpenGL ES 2.0 or later.
