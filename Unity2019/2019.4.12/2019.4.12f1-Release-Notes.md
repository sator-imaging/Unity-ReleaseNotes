### API Changes

*   Animation: Added: A new parameter was added to the MatchTarget function for auto matching completion in case of interruption
    
*   Build Pipeline: Added: Added internal API to capture performance data from the ContentBuildInterface methods.
    
*   iOS: Added: Added a public accessor for the legacy Game Center player ID, to give games an easier pathway to migrate to the new ID types in iOS 12.4
    

### Changes

*   Android: Bump Android Logcat verified version to 1.2.0
    
*   Timeline: Updated Timeline package version to 1.2.17
    

### Improvements

*   UI: Add soft masking to the RectMask2D. This gives the RectMask some alpha fade or X pixels. Also added the ability to add padding to the size of the Mask allowing for the user to extend the masking area without effecting the RectTransform

### Features

*   Package Manager: Added a UI for users to manage their Scoped Registries from inside the Editor. Also added a popup alert for when Scoped Registries are added to their project from outside that Scoped Registries management UI. The Scoped Registries management UI is automatically opened when the popup shows.

### System Requirements

### For development

#### OS: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.12+. (Server versions of Windows & OS X are not tested.)

#### CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.

#### GPU: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.

#### The rest mostly depends on the complexity of your projects.

### Additional platform development requirements:

*   iOS: Mac computer running minimum macOS 10.12.6 and Xcode 9.4 or higher.

*   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 (64-bit), Visual Studio 2015 with C++ Tools component or later and Windows 10 SDK
    

### For running Unity games

#### Generally content developed with Unity can run pretty much everywhere. How well it runs is dependent on the complexity of your project. More detailed requirements:

*   Desktop:
    
    *   OS: Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.12+, Ubuntu 16.04+
    *   Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
    *   CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.
*   iOS player requires iOS 10.0 or higher.
    
*   Android: OS 4.4 or later; ARMv7 CPU with NEON support; OpenGL ES 2.0 or later.
