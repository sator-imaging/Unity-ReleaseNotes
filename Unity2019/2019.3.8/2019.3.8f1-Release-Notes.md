*   2D: Added: Add GridPaintingState.paletteChanged to allow users to add callbacks when the active palette has changed
    
*   2D: Added: Add GridPaintingState.palettes to allow users to get a collection of all available Palettes
    

### Changes

*   2D: Make Tilemap.tilemapTileChanged and Tilemap.SyncTile public
    
*   Graphics: Changed default scripting backend of the Universal RP template to il2cpp

    *   OS: Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.12+, Ubuntu 16.04+
    *   Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
    *   CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.
*   iOS player requires iOS 10.0 or higher.
    
*   Android: OS 4.4 or later; ARMv7 CPU with NEON support; OpenGL ES 2.0 or later.
