### Improvements

*   Shadergraph: Removed duplicate LIGHTMAP\_ON and DIRLIGHTMAP\_COMBINED variants when generating shaders for builtin-deferred.
    
*   Universal RP: Updated the RenderGraph samples to use the new helper functions to reduce boilerplate code.
    

### Changes

*   Android: Removed limits on install-time delivery asset packs due to the new Google Play asset packs size and number limits. (UUM-68512)
    
*   Android: The new Google Play base module limit has been increased to 200Mb. (UUM-67708)

*   Package: Includes Apple privacy manifest file.
    

### Fixes

*   Audio: Fixed an issue that would cause Unity to crash when you manually destroy a streamed audio clip. ([UUM-14330](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-purecall-when-repeatedly-creating-playing-stopping-and-deleting-audio))
    
*   Editor: Added support for the OpenCL Compatibility Pack to Windows Arm64 installer because the GPU Lightmapper in the Editor requires it.
    
*   Editor: Favourites are now kept when entering Play mode. ([UVSB-2519](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/favorited-nodes-lose-their-favorite-setting-in-visual-scripting-after-entering-play-mode))
    
*   Editor: Fixed an issue where building in batch mode can open file explorer unexpectedly and cause a hang when running on headless windows servers. ([UUM-68288](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-revealinfinder-when-building-a-project-in-headless-mode))
    
*   Editor: Fixed errors related to the sqlite dll when using the Windows ARM64 Editor.
    
*   Editor: Removed the intentional crash after the time out for waiting for the DX12 fence. Also fixed related incorrect error log messages. ([UUM-30530](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-d3d12fence-wait-when-disabling-and-reenabling-reflection-probes))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed an issue related to baking local space line renderer in view align mode that didn't match rendering. ([UUM-59746](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mesh-collider-generated-on-a-rotated-slash-negative-scale-linerenderer-gameobject-is-incorrect-when-line-renderer-alignment-is-set-to-view))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed artifacts along the borders of a texture with transparency when the legacy ETC compressor is used. ([UUM-65381](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ui-texture-is-rendered-with-artifacts-when-etc-compressor-is-set-to-legacy-and-the-texture-format-is-set-to-rgba-compressed-etc2-8-bits))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed shadow flickering when using Umbra occlusion culling. ([UUM-67530](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shadows-flicker-when-moving-the-camera-when-the-far-clipping-plane-is-greater-than-3000))
    
*   HDRP: Fixed invalid AABB errors for some projects. ([UUM-69928](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/invalid-aabb-inaabb-errors-still-happening-in-some-projects))
    
*   Package: Removed the deprecation message for Vuforia package. ([UUM-65386](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/package-manager-com-dot-ptc-dot-vuforia-dot-engine-is-deprecated-this-package-is-no-longer-supported-on-this-editor-version-warning-appears-when-vuforia-engine-package-is-imported))
    
*   Particles: Enforced that a particle system using prewarm does nothing when calling Play from a script, especially if it was already playing. ([UUM-69074](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/currently-playing-particles-disappear-and-start-playing-again-when-the-particlesystem-dot-play-method-is-called))
    
*   Prefabs: Ensured AddedGameObjects re-parent correctly in broken scenes where they already have a parent. ([UUM-58305](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-block-remove-when-a-scene-is-opened-in-a-specific-project))
    
*   UI Elements: Fixed a where not having isDelayed set would mean that touchscreen keyboard input would not be captured on Platforms where input is only provided after the keyboard has closed. (UUM-53137)
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed AttributeOverrides tag overriding all elements with the same element name under a hierarchy of nested templates. (UUM-64821)
    
*   VisionOS: Fixed the Pause and Resume callbacks from being invoked twice when resuming from pause and causing a crash.
    
*   WebGL: Refactored code to have a more robust replacement operation when assembling the framework .js file. To achieve this, the `String.Replace` operation was set back to a `Regex.Replace`. To account for special characters and regex that might be present in the user jspre code (see UUM-21896), the final parameter uses an anonymous delegate function to treat the replacement string as a string literal so that it's not processed in any way. ([UUM-67705](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/jspre-files-are-not-included-when-building-for-webgl))
