### Features

*   Graphics: Added Foveated Rendering support for D3D12/Vulkan.
    
*   Video: WebGL VideoPlayer now has a configurable time update mode, to support game time, unscaled game time and audio dsp time.
    

### Improvements

*   SRP Core: Allow setting order for panels on the rendering debugger. (UUM-10698)

### API Changes

*   Graphics: Added: Added override to Mesh.AllocateWritableMeshData which takes an existing Mesh, Mesh List, or Mesh array which returns a MeshDataArray already populated with the existing Mesh data. This data is accessible from worker (non main) thread contexts and avoids complicated MeshDataArray construction which was needed before this API.

### Fixes

*   AI: Fixed an issue that patches of the generated NavMesh were sometimes getting the area type from distant objects below due to their connection through a sloped wall. ([UUM-3457](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/navmesh-modifiers-influence-navmesh-areas-far-above-them-on-asset-edges-when-using-notwalkable-or-water-modifier))
    
*   Editor: Changed the Name of a Renderer Feature in a URP renderer setting does not throw errors anymore. ([UUM-10175](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-changing-the-name-field-of-a-renderer-feature-causes-argumentnullexception-to-be-thrown))

*   Editor: Fixed exception incorrectly reporting object already in pool when equal instances of classes implementing IEquatable<T> are released to ObjectPool. (UUM-8083)
    
*   Editor: Fixed the text highlight on UI Toolkit settings panels.
    
*   Editor: Fixed unexpected sorting on some VFX output while using the new SG integration. (UUM-12152)

*   HDRP: Display Stats is now always shown in the first position on the Rendering Debugger. (UUM-10698)

*   Physics: Fixed ArticulationBody SetDriveTargets and SetDriveTargetVelocities methods checking List capacity instead of count and improved the error message.

    _First seen in 2023.1.0a4._
