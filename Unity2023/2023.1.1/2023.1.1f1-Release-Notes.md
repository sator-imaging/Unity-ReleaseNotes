### Features

*   Test Framework: Added TestFileReferences.json to be generated on build step of the player, so can be consumed later by Test runners to enrich data for run part.
    
*   Test Framework: By using the editor command line new argument -randomOrderSeed x you can run the tests in a randomized order, where x is an integer different from 0. If a new test is added in the project the random order passing the same seed will be kept, and the new test will be placed in the random list accordigly.
    
*   Test Framework: The UTF version now automatically updates for SRP tests
    

### Improvements

*   Editor: Fixed an issue where RFloat / RGFloat / RGBAFloat formats were not useable in the Texture Importer Inspector even though they already could be applied through, for example, an AssetPostprocessor.
    
*   Graphics: Graphics.Blit now supports source signed textures (no remapping if blitting from signed to unsigned). (UUM-6249)
    
*   VFX Graph: Allows texture types to be used in branch operators ([UUM-38037](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vfx-graph-branch-node-does-not-accept-texture-input))
    
*   VFX Graph: VFX systems receiving GPU events can now go into sleep state

*   GI: Lighting bake stops with error 2 ('AddGeometry' failed with exit code: 4)". Error is thrown without telling which mesh is problematic. ([UUM-32710](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/lighting-bake-stops-with-error-2-addgeometry-failed-with-exit-code-4-error-is-thrown-without-telling-which-mesh-is-problematic-when-generating-lighting))

*   iOS: Delete unneeded files when replacing the build ([UUM-27977](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-building-project-on-top-of-existing-foled-with-replace-option-doesnt-fully-delete-the-previous-project-files))
    
*   iOS: Fix assert error in iOS.Device.systemVersion and tvOS.Device.systemVersion. Also make there properties only return values on respective OSes. (UUM-16561)
    
*   Linux: Fixed Unity Editor does not send exit code until Bug Reporter is closed (UUM-34630)
    
*   Linux: Fixed Unity runtime printing stack trace more than once in Entities package + IL2CPP crashes ([UUM-35527](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/entities-linux-il2cpp-player-crash-stack-trace-is-displayed-multiple-times-when-the-build-is-run-with-batchmode-nographics-arguments))
    
*   Particles: Fix sub-emitter preview incorrectly pausing if parent particles are finished. ([UUM-36773](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particle-subemitter-simulation-is-not-completed-when-previewing))

*   Serialization: It is not possible to instantiate abstract class, which is happening in this case. The fix for editor crash is to make sure that the abstract StatusEffect class is not instantiated in SerializedReference fields. You can achieve this by either changing all the occurrences, or add \[MovedFrom(true, sourceClassName:"StatusEffect")\] attribute to StatusEffectComplex class. ([UUM-9218](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-crashes-with-the-file-memorystream-is-corrupted-when-opening-a-scene))
    
*   Serialization: When serializing empty managed object reference we are not adding the data node in the YAML, which is causing problems after some fields are added to the script and the YAML is being de-serialized. In this case, as there still is not any data node in the YAML, the deserialization process is not instantiating the managed object correctly. ([UUM-2258](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/changes-to-an-empty-serializereference-class-causes-data-errorswhen-selecting-a-previously-created-asset))
    
*   Shaders: Fix interpolator parameter GLSL generated code for EVAL\_SAMPLE\_INDEX, EVAL\_SNAPPED, EVAL\_CENTROID. (UUM-35468)
    
*   Shaders: Fixed "State comes from an incompatible keyword space" error when using dynamic branching with use pass or fallbacks. ([UUM-37468](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/incompatible-keyword-states-error))
    
*   Shaders: Fixed progress bar sometimes not appearing when "Compile and show code" button is pressed in the shader inspector. ([UUM-27865](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-compilation-stuck-on-0-slash-6144-variants-ready-when-trying-to-compile-a-shader))
    
*   Test Framework: Fix for WebGL platform target to close the browser tab when the run is completed.
    
*   TextCore: Corrected the improper ratio between character spacing and word spacing for justified alignment. We intend to introduce an adjustable property to allow for fine-tuning of this ratio. ([UUM-30367](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ui-toolkit-spaces-between-letters-are-too-big-when-using-align-equals-justified-tag))
    
*   TextCore: Ensure <voffset> tag affects the preferred height values. ([UUM-28446](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/voffset-text-inside-label-goes-out-of-label-bounds-when-visualelement-is-resized))
    
*   TextCore: Fix "NullReferenceException" thrown when renaming Sprite in the Sprite Character Table ([UUM-18062](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/error-nullreferenceexception-is-thrown-when-renaming-sprite-in-the-sprite-character-table))
    
*   TextCore: Fix exception thrown when parsing an invalid tag. ([UUM-11753](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unicode-character-error-in-console-when-browsing-assets-in-package-manager))
    
*   UI: Fixes the UI rendering to use the render-target dimensions instead of the display buffer dimensions when calling ScriptableRenderContext.DrawUIOverlay from an SRP. ([UUM-12865](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/rendered-textures-overlay-ui-has-a-different-size-compared-to-the-rendered-texture-in-the-scene-view))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed issue where sprites used incorrect indexes. ([UUM-30797](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sprites-with-different-indexes-than-indicated-in-text-field-of-label-inspector-are-being-rendered))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed selection when the carriage return (\\r) is being used. ([UUM-8181](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unable-to-select-all-text-when-using-slash-r-escape-character))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed UI Toolkit not rendering in render texture when launched in batch mode. ([UUM-26763](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ui-toolkit-is-not-rendered-when-the-player-is-launched-in-batch-mode))
    
*   URP: Fixed redundant blit is used due to postFX, although it is disabled in rendererData. ([UUM-31474](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/quest-urp-enabling-post-processing-on-a-camera-when-its-disabled-on-the-urp-settings-forces-rendering-into-an-intermediate-texture))
    
*   VFX Graph: Fix a potential crash with particle strips ([UUM-36762](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-crashes-on-vfxparticlesystembatchdata-copydeadlistcount-when-opening-the-project))
    
*   VFX Graph: Fix an editor only memory leak with VFX Graph objects
    
*   VFX Graph: Fix data serialization that could lead to corrupted state (UUM-25417)
    
*   VFX Graph: Fix VFX assets being considered modified after creation ([UUM-35056](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/asterisk-is-displayed-near-a-newly-created-vfx-graphs-name-when-in-reality-no-changes-have-been-made))
    
*   WebGL: - Fixed webCamTexture.DidUpdateThisFrame not getting correctly updated ([UUM-29274](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webcamtexture-dot-didupdatethisframe-returns-true-only-for-the-first-frame-when-the-project-is-built-for-webgl))
    
*   Windows: Fixed a bug with multi-channel audio input on Windows. If we tried to capture from a microphone with more than 2 channels, Microphone.Start would fail and an "Unsupported file or audio format" error would appear in the console. (UUM-26565)
