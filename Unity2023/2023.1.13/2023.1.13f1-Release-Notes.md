### API Changes

*   Particles: Added: Added new custom vertex streams: particle index, mesh axis of rotation, and color packed as 2 floats.

### Changes

*   Editor: Accessing Transform data from 'OnDestroy' during an Undo operation is no longer allowed and an error message is logged. ([UUM-31100](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/transform-is-used-before-awake-or-illegal-transform-access-error-appears-when-accessing-gameobject-transform-from-ondestroy-if-the-gameobject-is-deleted-by-an-undo-operation))
    
*   Package: Updated com.unity.scripting.python package's version to 7.0.1.
    

### Fixes

*   Android: Fixed a bug related to the "Mute Other Audio Sources" player setting on Android. There were two cases where another app's audio might not get muted when it should be. This could happen if the other app was started before the Unity app or if the other app was played via the Android "quick panel" after the Unity app was started. ([UUM-37753](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-muteotheraudiosources-not-muting-background-music-when-starting-the-player))
    
*   Android: Fixed AndroidJavaProxy not always finding over private methods. ([UUM-44752](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-androidjavaproxy-cannot-find-a-private-proxy-method-when-button-is-clicked))
    
*   Audio: Added lazy `loopEnd` evaluation to avoid keeping a value of 0. Downloaded audio files were were not updating this, causing a division by zero in the playback process.
