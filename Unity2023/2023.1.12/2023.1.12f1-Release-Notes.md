### Features

*   XR: Unity's integrated support for tone-mapping and outputting to HDR Displays in URP, HDRP and the built-in render pipeline has been extended to allow support for XR devices that have a HDR display.

### Fixes

*   Editor: Fixed "Can not play a disabled audio source" warning when audio mute is toggled in scene view on with disabled Audio Source in the Scene. ([UUM-31541](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/can-not-play-a-disabled-audio-source-is-thrown-when-audio-is-toggled-on-with-disabled-audio-source-in-the-scene))
    
*   Editor: Fixed bug where reserved GLSL words couldn't be used as buffer variable names in compute shaders targeting Vulkan. ([UUM-41272](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shaders-using-glsl-reserved-words-fail-to-compile-when-using-vulkan-graphics-api))
    
*   Editor: Fixed crash when in Deleted GameObjects as overrides. ([UUM-45217](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-destroyremovedgameobjects-when-opening-a-specific-scene))
    
*   Editor: Fixed extra 38-byte header in DXIL generated for shaders. ([UUM-37067](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dx12-shaderdata-dot-variantcompileinfo-dot-shaderdata-contains-38-extra-bytes-on-directx-12))
    
*   Editor: Fixed issue where "Top level scope allocation is permitted only on the main thread." error thrown when using Allocator.Temp. ([UUM-45483](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/top-level-scope-allocation-is-permitted-only-on-the-main-thread-dot-error-thrown-when-using-allocator-dot-temp))
    
*   Editor: Fixed possible crash in AudioMixer.SetFloat when entering play mode. ([UUM-35984](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-audiomixercontroller-setfloat-when-entering-the-play-mode))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed an issue where the mipmap streaming system did not take runtime changes to material texture scale properties. ([UUM-31184](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/texture-mipmap-streaming-uses-wrong-scales-after-materials-are-changed-at-runtime))
    
*   Linux: Fixed a bug with surround sound hardware not being detected on Linux. Fixed an issue on Windows where we would not re-init audio output correctly, when the Unity project requested surround sound, and the Editor or player was started with no such hardware available. When surround sound hardware is later enabled and set as the default output, it will now be used. ([UUM-348](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unity-does-not-recognize-surround-sound-driver-capabilities-and-plays-audio-in-stereo))
    
*   Scene/Game View: Fixed unusually high CPU usage when more than one Game View was open. ([UUM-44719](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/very-high-cpu-and-gpu-usage-when-2-game-views-are-visible-at-the-same-time))
    
*   Universal RP: Fixed an issue where additional lights were not rendering correctly when using a mix of shadow settings in deferred. ([UUM-46577](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hard-shadows-appear-in-the-game-view-when-enabling-cast-shadows))
    
*   Universal RP: Fixed an issue where IndexOutOfRangeException was thrown when creating a stacked camera from script. ([UUM-6763](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/indexoutofrangeexception-when-generating-stack-camera))
    
*   Universal RP: Fixed an issue where NullReferenceException was thrown when camera prefab referenced a camera outside the prefab in the camera stack. ([UUM-23148](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/error-nullreferenceexception-is-thrown-when-making-a-prefab-from-a-camera-that-has-another-camera-in-its-stack))
    
*   Universal RP: Fixed color and depth mismatch when scaling is on. ([UUM-29397](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/combining-copy-depth-render-scale-and-off-screen-target-throws-error))
    
*   Universal RP: Fixed shader stripping when using APV. ([UUM-42601](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/baked-lightmaps-are-not-applied-in-the-player))
    
*   WebGL: Resolve an issue making the WebGL player attempt to retry editor connections on unsupported network ports. (UUM-44239)
