### Features

*   Graphics: Added new RayTracingAccelerationStructure.AddInstance signature that allows adding Mesh instances into the acceleration structure for GPU ray tracing. This is the equivalent of Graphics.RenderMesh from rasterization pipeline.
    
*   HDRP: Added Ray Tracing Terrain support for HDRP.
    

### Improvements

*   Build Pipeline: Improved error handling for builds to show less redundant error messages.
    
*   Burst: Used explicit namespace for UnityEditor.PackageManager.Events to avoid conflicts.
    
*   HDRP: Enabled multi-editing for Diffusion Profiles.
    
*   HDRP: Improved rendering by adding caustics support for cinematic eye shader in HDRP material samples eye graph.
    
*   Physics: Added a field in the PhysicsManager inspector that exposes the number of 16kb chunks used by PhysX's temporary scratch buffer, the default number of chunks is 4 with a total of 64kb of memory allocated. The scratch buffer size can be seen inside the memory profiler as an allocation root.
    
*   Physics: Added a temporary scratch buffer to the Physics simulation, in order to improve performance by avoiding going to the main allocator for small temporary allocations.
    
*   Serialization: Improved performance for cases where endianness needs to be swapped during (de)serialization.
    

### API Changes

*   Graphics: Added: Introduces Native Renderpass API on CommandBuffer.
    
*   Graphics: Added: Material.GetBufferHandle to get the GraphicsBufferHandle in a material property sheet.
    
*   Graphics: Added: Material.GetPropertyNames(<PropertyType>) to query the property sheet names in a material based on a given property type.
    
*   Graphics: Added: New Foveated Rendering API on the command buffer interface.
    
*   Graphics: Added: New overload for CommandBuffer.SetComputeBufferParam, which allows binding a resource with GraphicsBufferHandle.
    
*   Graphics: Added: RenderPipeline.IsRenderRequestSupported. Protected method, render pipelines can override this to specify their support for RequestData types.
    
*   Graphics: Added: RenderPipeline.ProcessRenderRequest. Protected method, render pipelines can override this to implement the rendering logic for RenderRequests.
    
*   Graphics: Added: RenderPipeline.StandardRequest. Use this as the RequestData parameter in SubmitRenderRequest to trigger a default srp render on the specified camera.
    
*   Graphics: Added: RenderPipeline.SubmitRenderRequest. Triggers a render with the active render pipeline according to the passed in RequestData.
    
*   Graphics: Added: RenderPipeline.SupportsRenderRequest. Checks the active pipeline whether the given RequestData type is supported.
    
*   SRP Core: Added: An extension method to fetch the Render Pipeline assets from a BuildTarget.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Added: Added the necessary Experimental APIs to interact with subsections of the Text. (UUM-4313)
    
*   Universal: Added: UniversalRenderPipeline.SingleCameraRequest. Use this as the RequestData parameter in SubmitRenderRequest to render a single camera.
    
*   Universal: Obsoleted: RenderSingleCamera is now obsolete. Please use RenderPipeline.SubmitRenderRequest with RequestData of the SingleCameraRequest type.  
    Graphics: Camera.SubmitRenderRequests is now obsolete. Please use RenderPipeline.SubmitRenderRequest with RequestData of a supported type such as RenderPipeline.StandardRequest.
    
*   URP: Added: Added light cookies stripping.
    

### Changes

*   UI Toolkit: ColorField is now UI Toolkit based and does not rely on an IMGUIContainer.
    
*   URP: Foveated Rendering is now integrated in URP for supported platforms.
