### Features

*   Asset Bundles: Added capability to Asset Bundles that target Windows/OSX/Linux platforms and the Dedicated Server subtarget so that they are now built with the same Dedicated Server optimizations that built Dedicated Server Players receive (removing texture data and non-collision mesh data).

### Improvements

*   Android: Added comments in manifest templates regarding which activities should be used.
    
*   Bug Reporter: Added a token representing the Unity ID account that you are currently signed in to the Bug Reporter, if the Hub is running and you are signed in at the time you file a bug report.
    
*   Build Pipeline: Enabled always using UnityLinker to collect referenced assemblies (even if code stripping is disabled), which is faster than the old code path used for that case.
    
*   DX12: Implemented a new threading model to improve both Editor and standalone performance.
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed incorrect metadata collection/inflation for generic methods.
    
*   Profiler: Reduced the performance cost of drawing charts in the profiler.
    
*   Scripting: Added a few missing convenience methods to RectInt.
    
*   UI Toolkit: Disabled internal update of ViewData feature for Runtime UI, in order to improve performance. This feature is Editor-only.
    

### API Changes

*   Editor: Added: IDataModeController is added to handle data mode related functionalities. (DOTSE-1855)
    
*   Editor: Obsoleted: IDataModeHandler and IDataModeHandlerAndDispatcher are obsoleted. (DOTSE-1855)
    
*   Physics: Added: Added a way to generate contact points between shapes without running the simulation.
    
*   Scripting: Added: Added AwaitableCompletionSource implementation as well as Methods to switch to main/background threads. (SCP-593)
    

### Changes

*   Android: Removed a validation error which checks if activities specified in manifest are present as java files. Activities can be implemented in jar files, so Unity is unable to check that.
    
*   HDRP: Disabled HDRP Global Settings when HDRP is not active.
    
*   Universal RP: Removed support for GLES2.0 and WebGL1.0.
    
*   URP: Disabled HDRP Global Settings when HDRP is not active.
