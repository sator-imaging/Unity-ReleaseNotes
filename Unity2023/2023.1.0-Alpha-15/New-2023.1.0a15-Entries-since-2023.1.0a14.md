### Features

*   Core: Merged the APV window with the Lighting window.
    
*   TextMeshPro: Added support for Color Glyphs and extracting OpenType font features.
    
*   Universal RP: Added Detailed Stats to URP Rendering Debugger.
    

### Improvements

*   Android: Enabled printing of Device Model, Operating System, Device API Level, Min API Level, Target API Level when app starts.
    
*   Shadergraph: Modified the AssetPostprocessor for Shader Graph so it now performs the majority of its work when a shader-related asset has been changed.
    

### API Changes

*   iOS: Added: Added identifiers for iPhone 14 models.
    
*   Scripting: Added: Added type AwaitableCoroutine usable as an async method return type, and providing await compatibility for coroutines such as NextFrame, UnityEvent, AsyncGPUReadBacks or any AsyncOperation.
    
*   Search: Added: Exposed New search APIs.
    
*   Search: Obsoleted: Deprecated APIs related to IMGUI.
    
*   Search: Removed: Removed obsolete APIs.
    
*   SRP Core: Added: Added bigQuery Nested columns extensions.
    
*   SRP Core: Changed: Moved HDRP & URP IPostProcessComponent to shared IPostprocessComponent interface under RP Core package in UnityEngine.Rendering namespace.
    

### Changes

*   Android: Modified the input device listener so it now processes the callback on the UI thread. The callbacks were previously being processed in Unity's main thread but this is incompatible with the GameActivity setup, where Java looper is not present on Unity's main thread.
    
*   Documentation: Added documentation for public-facing methods EditorUserBuildSettings.SwitchActiveBuildTarget, NamedBuildTarget.FromBuildTargetGroup, and NamedBuildTarget.ToBuildTargetGroup.
    
*   Editor: Disabled the `CS0282` compiler warning when `PlayerSettings.SuppressCommonWarnings` is enabled.
    
*   Editor: Implemented RationalTime for Time Management.
    
*   iOS: Removed ALWAYS\_EMBED\_SWIFT\_STANDARD\_LIBRARIES from being enforced when a Swift file is encountered. If it is still needed (for swift4 plugins), it can be set in the post-processor script. (UUM-10232)  
    _First seen in 2023.1.0a1._
