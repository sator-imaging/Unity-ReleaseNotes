### Improvements

*   HDRP: Improved CPU performances by disabling "QuantizedFrontToBack" sorting in opaque rendering.

### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed a Nullptr lens flare data driven 2d bis.
    
*   2D: Fixed an issue where the MainTexTexelSize property is not being set when compiling a Shader. ([UUM-27287](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-maintex-texelsize-property-is-not-being-set-when-compiling-a-shader))  
    _First seen in 2023.1.0b4._
    
*   2D: Fixed bug with placement of the Tilemap Instantiated Object when the Tilemap orientation is set. (UUM-36433)
    
*   2D: Fixed case where sprite Packer does not re-pack folder when texture type is changed to sprite when inside a target folder. ([UUM-34323](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sprite-atlas-v2-sprite-packer-does-not-re-pack-folder-when-texture-type-is-changed-to-sprite-when-inside-a-target-folder))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue with async unloading which could cause errors and crashes in AssetDatabase.CreateAsset(). ([UUM-20313](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-typetreequeries-hashtypetree-when-generating-terrain-with-gaia-pro))

    _First seen in 2023.2.0a1._
    
*   Editor: Fixed an issue that caused some packages to remain visible in the Project Window when the visibility button was toggled. ([UUM-35156](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/pre-installed-2d-packages-are-not-hidden-when-the-visibility-toggle-is-clicked-in-the-project-window))
    
*   Editor: Fixed an issue that caused the assets of some packages to remain visible in the Object Picker when the visibility button in the Project Window was toggled. ([UUM-21308](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/object-picker-lists-assets-from-packages-when-packages-assets-visibility-is-set-to-hidden))
    
*   Editor: Fixed an issue where a UnityException ("Could not find the requested Platform Texture Settings. This is incorrect, did initialization fail?") would sometimes be thrown when inspecting multiple texture importers at the same time. ([UUM-15620](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unityexception-could-not-find-the-requested-platform-texture-settings-is-thrown-when-multi-selecting-textures))
    
*   Editor: Fixed an issue where users would sometimes be prompted to save their changes by the Texture Importer Inspector despite having not changed any of the importer settings. (UUM-19921)
    
*   Editor: Fixed for editor freeze on macOS. ([UUM-30173](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/macos-editor-freezes-when-saving-prefab-changes-in-play-mode-if-vsync-is-enabled))
    
*   Editor: Fixed for editor hang that could happen, when an import in worker process fails because of asset being changed during the import. Any following sync import (using ProduceArtifact API) request for this asset, would cause editor to hang. (UUM-22607)
    
*   Editor: Fixed meshes from 2019 LTS and older being upgraded to use an incorrect "Margin Method" setting for Lightmap UV generation. (UUM-37456)

*   Editor: For URP and HDRP moved the Realtime GI CPU Usage setting to the Quality tab in Project Settings. ([UUM-28789](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/quality-settings-missing-cpu-usage-setting-users-unable-to-tune-realtime-gi-performance))
    
*   Graphics: Avoid false warnings about RenderTexture format when switching colorspace. (UUM-6770)
    
*   Graphics: Fixed flickering issue with gpu batched skinning on D3D11 graphics api.
    
*   Graphics: Improved performance when initially loading async uploaded textures. (UUM-25862)  
    _First seen in 2023.1.0b3._
    
*   HDRP: Added check to ensure gismos arent rendered when they shouldnt be. ([UUM-22315](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gizmos-are-visible-when-disabled-in-wireframe-shading-mode-with-hdrp))
    
*   HDRP: Fixed cloud layer rotation does not allow for smooth rotation. ([UUM-35087](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-hdrp-cloud-rotation-does-not-allow-for-smooth-rotation-at-low-rotation-speeds))
    
*   HDRP: Fixed GetScaledSize when not using scaling. (UUM-34513)
    
*   HDRP: Fixed quad overdraw debug at high resolution. (UUM-33220)
    
*   HDRP: Fixed TAA aliasing edge issues on alpha output for recorder / green screen. This fix does the following:  
    
    *   Removes history rejection when the current alpha value is 0. Instead it does blend with the history color when alpha value is 0 on the current plane.  
        
    *   The reasoning for blending again with the history when alpha is 0 is because we want the color to blend a bit with opacity, which is the main reason for the alpha values. sort of like a precomputed color  
        
    *   As a safety, we set the color to black if alpha is 0. This results in better image quality when alpha is enabled. ([UUM-33950](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/anti-aliasing-around-objects-results-in-outlines-when-recording-against-a-background))
*   HDRP: Fixed VT init to avoid RTHandle allocation outside of HDRP rendering loop. (UUM-31058)
    
*   HDRP: Upgrading from DLSS 2.4 to DLSS 3.0 for upscaling part. (UUM-36246)
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed LineNumberMapping.json not ending up in exported projects when --emit-source-mapping is used. ([UUM-29964](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-no-c-number-to-c-plus-plus-line-mapping-json-file-present-when-exporting-android-project))
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed Marshal.OffsetOf returning the wrong offsets for explicit layouts. ([UUM-35032](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-inputsystem-reports-incorrect-inputs-on-macos-with-il2cpp-player-builds-when-using-xboxonegamepadmacoswireless-controller))

*   iOS: Fixed BuildCanBeAppended returning Unsupported when used on Windows. ([UUM-25061](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/buildcanbeappended-for-ios-returns-unsupported-when-used-on-windows))
    
*   iOS: Fixed Images.xcassets not being added to the xcode project (resulting in icons not being set). ([UUM-32547](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-appicon-fails-to-be-added-to-the-xcode-project))
    
*   iOS: Fixed low memory usage event not triggered when using Unity as a library. ([UUM-20838](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-application-dot-lowmemory-callback-is-not-invoked-on-ios-devices-when-a-memory-overflow-occurs-if-using-unity-as-a-library-embedded-into-a-native-swift-ios-application))
