*   HDRP: Fixed color pyramid history buffer logic when history is reset and the color pyramid is not required. ([UUM-36095](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/indexoutofrangeexception-error-is-thrown-when-entering-play-mode-while-allow-dlss-refraction-and-distortion-are-selected-in-the-camera-component))
