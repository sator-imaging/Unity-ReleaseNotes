### Features

*   2D: Added SRP Batching for 2D Renderers and Particle Renderer to support URP.
    
*   Graphics: Added support for loading EXR data via ImageConversion.LoadImage().
    
*   VFX Graph: Added VFX integration in Ray Tracing.
    

### Improvements

*   Android: Application.memoryUsageChanged is now powered by https://developer.android.com/games/sdk/memory-advice/start.
    
*   Core: Added Transform.SetLocalPositionAndRotation(). This allows you to set both the localPosition and localRotation of a transform in a single call, which is more efficient than assigning to localPosition and localRotation separately. (Thank you to @DevDunk on the forum for the request!).
    
*   Graphics: Improved AlphaIsTransparency API docs and tooltip. ([UUM-2364](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/color-artifacts-in-imported-textures-when-alpha-source-is-set-to-input-texture-alpha))
    
*   HDRP: Updated an out-of-date guide in TextureStack.hlsl. (UUM-2513)
    

### API Changes

*   Editor: Added: New NativeArray.ReadOnly's UnsafeElementAt returns ref readonly as an alternative to this\[index\] copy.
    
*   GI: Obsoleted: Enlighten Baking is now obsolete and no longer available. Users are recommended to user the Progressive lightmapper instead.
    
*   Physics: Added: Added new method (Physics.RunSimulationStages) to run individual physics simulation sub-steps to allow greater control over the simulation process.
    
*   Shaders: Added: Added an API to control shader memory usage at runtime. ([UUM-5583](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unlit-shader-uses-more-than-100mb-of-memory-when-in-player))
    

### Changes

*   Package: Updated the Python for .NET DLL to a custom patch, based on the official version 3.0.0-rc4. Commit hash: 7ffad42406e36cda9e4be7eb4ad533e45502a60d of Unity's Pythonnet fork.
    
*   Universal RP: Light soft shadow quality setting in URPAsset which lights use by default. Per light override is still possible.

*   Input: Removed emulation of keyboard key presses when L1/R1/L2/R2/Start/Select are pressed on gamepad on Android with input system package. Before they were triggering left/right shift/alt, enter and pause keys. ([UUM-7557](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dualshock4-several-buttons-force-a-switch-to-keyboard-mapping-on-android-or-ios))

*   Shaders: Fixed Shader Variant Collection UI not working correctly with shaders with stage-specific keywords. ([UUM-12220](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/some-shader-variants-dont-show-up-when-vertex-is-added-to-shader-code))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed TextValueField allocation when setting the same value. ([UUM-8156](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/this-dot-valuetostring-this-dot-rawvalue-is-called-every-time-when-setting-floatfield-dot-value-to-the-same-value))
