### Improvements

*   GI: Updated to the Lightmap Parameters Custom UI to make it easy to understand what each parameter should affect.
    
*   Graphics: Registration of the Shader.globalRenderpipeline is done internaly and using the renderPipelineShaderTag from the RenderPipelineAsset that is currently in use.
    
*   Prefabs: Users can now see that an overridden property value is identical to that of its source on the Property context menu item for 'Revert'. \[https://jira.unity3d.com/browse/SMT-127\].
    
*   Scripting: When using ObjectFactory.CreateInstance with a custom type deriving directly from UnityEngine.Object, a clearer exception message is thrown. ([UUM-7896](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/argumentexception-thrown-when-calling-objectfactory-dot-createinstance-with-a-custom-class-inheriting-from-unityengine-dot-object-1))

*   Graphics: Added: Added overridable property renderPipelineShaderTag on the RenderPipelineAsset.
    
*   License: Added: Added GetEntitlementDetails.
    
*   Scene/Game View: Added: Added `Handles.elementColor` to the public API, allowing user defined `EditorToolContext` to have consistent default coloring for Edit Mode objects.

*   URP: Improved motion vector pass. It should now use the same matrices as the Lit shader.
    
*   XR: Removed deprecated package `com.unity.xr.arkit-face-tracking` from AR Feature Set. The APIs from ARKit Face Tracking package has been moved to ARKit package.
