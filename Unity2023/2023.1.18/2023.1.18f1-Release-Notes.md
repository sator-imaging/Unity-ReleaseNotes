*   HDRP: New checkbox in surface options to allow materials to be excluded from temporal anti aliasing. The checkbox name is "RemoveFromTUAndAA". This checkbox is ideal for surfaces that contain texture scrolling that has to be neat and does not have velocity information.  
    For now, this checkbox is only exposed to transparent materials since they are the only ones that can fit a stencil bit for such operation. (UUM-37206)
