### Features

*   2D: Added Brush Picks to the Tile Palette window.
    
*   Graphics: Added DirectX Raytracing (DXR) 1.1 support in compute shaders. Added the following APIs: SystemInfo.supportsInlineRayTracing, SystemInfo.supportsRayTracingShaders, ComputeShader.SetRayTracingAccelerationStructure, and CommandBuffer.SetRayTracingAccelerationStructure(ComputeShader, ...). Added `#pragma require inlineraytracing` to compute shaders.
    
*   HDRP: Added a third level of noise for volumetric clouds.
    
*   HDRP: Added various improvements to the HDRP Water System.
    
*   Physics 2D: Added the ability to use sub-stepping simulation when Simulation Mode is **Update**.
    
*   Shaders: Added standard shader variant for native 16-bit shader types.
    
*   URP: Added Decal support to Render Graph.
    

### Improvements

*   Android: Enabled handling APK/OBB files that are larger than 2GB. (UUM-14411)  
    _First seen in 2023.1.0a9._
    
*   Editor: Added a Jobs Preference menu to the **Edit** > **Preferences** window. This window allows specifying the Native Leak Detection mode, the use of Job Threads, and Enabling/Disabling the Job Debugger (also known as the Job Safety System).
    
*   HDRP: Improved CPU shadow performance with burst.
    
*   N/A (internal): Added a tiled rendering test in DXR Tests project for better coverage.

*   Scripting: Fixed APIUpdater so it now longer corrupts sources when updating attributes with parameters.
    
*   Scripting: Fixed documentation for didStart.
    
*   Scripting: Fixed the caching of package assemblies so it no longer causes script debugging to pick up files from a different project.
    
*   Scripting: Removed the ability to disable Roslyn Analyzers, since a lot of functionality relies on Source Generators having run. ([UUM-11374](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/m1-ui-canvas-cant-render-images))  
    _First seen in 2023.1.0a4._
