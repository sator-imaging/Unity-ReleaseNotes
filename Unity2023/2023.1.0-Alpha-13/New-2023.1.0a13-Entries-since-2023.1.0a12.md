### API Changes

*   Editor: Added: Added new SupportedOnRenderPipeline attribute.
    
*   Graphics: Added: Added Mesh.SetBindposes that takes a NativeArray.
    
*   Graphics: Changed: Changed the Render Graph API to support the modern buffer resource, GraphicsBuffer (Previously ComputeBuffer).
    
*   Graphics: Changed: Moved RayTracingAccelerationStructure and RayTracingShader classes from UnityEngine.Experimental.Rendering to UnityEngine.Rendering.
    

### Changes

*   Package: Updated Code Coverage package to v1.2.0.

### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed case where Sprite Atlas changes Secondary Texture when entering Play mode. ([UUM-11355](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/sprite-atlas-changes-secondary-texture-when-entering-play-mode))
    
*   2D: Fixed issue where Atlas pack preview dropdown does not show packed normal maps. ([UUM-12752](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/2d-sprite-atlas-atlas-pack-preview-dropdown-does-not-show-packed-normal-maps))
    
*   AI: Colliders set as trigger are excluded from NavMesh generation. ([UUM-10109](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/trigger-volumes-are-included-in-nav-mesh-generation-for-navmeshsurface-when-geometry-is-set-to-physics-colliders))
    
*   Android: Added support for Android's AAudio engine, so on Android 8.1 and later, Unity Audio is now layered over AAudio. This fixes 4 audio bugs, related to built-in stereo speaker output, built-in vs. Bluetooth microphone selection, Microphone.Start and Microphone.Stop CPU spikes, and low-latency audio output. ([UUM-3727](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-the-microphone-recording-is-faulty-when-the-bluetooth-headset-is-connected-to-the-phone-before-opening-the-application), [UUM-3732](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-microphone-dot-start-method-invocation-causes-high-ping-spikes), [UUM-3745](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-when-dsp-buffer-size-is-set-to-best-latency-the-audio-plays-significantly-slower-and-is-crackling-on-oneplus-7-pro), [UUM-3746](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-audio-stereo-pan-is-reversed-when-orientation-is-set-to-landscape-right-on-some-devices))
    
*   Animation: Fixed Avatar Masks with non-empty transforms which were mistakenly preventing material to be animated. ([1369876](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/avatar-masks-with-non-empty-transforms-prevent-material-reference-animation-of-all-but-material-slot-0))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed case of SRP changing mid refresh resulting in infinite imports. ([UUM-11957](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefab-importing-gets-stuck-on-project-opening-when-parallel-importing-is-enabled))
    
*   Editor: Fixed an issue that the job worker threads will now prefer executing jobs scheduled during job execution, avoiding long job wait --> steal --> wait -> steal chains which could result in a stack overflow. (UUM-10271)  
    _First seen in 2023.1.0a5._
    
*   Editor: Fixed deadlock scenario in shader compiler. (UUM-14040)
    
*   Editor: Fixed pan mode shortcuts. ([UUM-8450](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ctrl-plus-alt-plus-lmb-for-navigating-does-not-work-in-scene-view))  
    _First seen in 2023.1.0a3._
    
*   Graphics: Fixed an issue where SystemInfo.GetCompatibleFormat would return an incompatible format for certain depth-stencil formats + FormatUsage combinations. (UUM-3789)
    
*   Graphics: Fixed an issue where TextureImporter.GetAutomaticFormat would return the incorrect format for platforms that had their override turned off. ([UUM-11694](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/textureimporter-dot-getautomaticformat-doesnt-return-the-correct-format-when-override-for-os-is-turned-off))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed for depth submission crash when no MSAA is enabled (Quest 2). ([UUM-13249](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/graphics-crash-when-submitting-depth-with-no-msaa))  
    _First seen in 2023.1.0a5._
    
*   Graphics: Fixed mipmap streaming not properly taking into account mipmap limit settings. (UUM-11567)
    
*   Graphics: Fixed mipmap stripping not properly taking into account mipmap limit settings. (UUM-11568)
    
*   Kernel: Fixed and issue that the main thread now only steals work when explicitly waiting for a job when there are more jobs than worker threads available. When waiting for jobs explicitly, we will always attempt to execute a parallel portion of the job being waited on before stealing another job. (UUM-10808, UUM-10874)  
    _First seen in 2023.1.0a6._

*   Particles: Fixed code that stops particle systems and triggers stop actions, to prevent out of bounds array access. (UUM-1237)
    
*   Particles: Fixed null reference exceptions when previewing particles in the Scene View. ([UUM-11674](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nullreferenceexception-in-particle-systems-shape-module-while-reference-is-set))
    
*   Particles: Orbital velocity curves must all use the same mode. Display an error and don't crash, if this is not the case. ([UUM-8679](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-evaluateslow-when-running-particle-system))
    
*   Particles: Shape module uses updated texture data if script calls ReadPixels/SetPixels etc. ([UUM-13054](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shape-module-texture-not-updating-in-the-game-view-when-changing-the-shape-module-texture-to-different-procedurally-generated-textures))
    
*   Particles: Show/hide trail material slot in Prefab when toggling the Trails module in the Inspector. ([UUM-10035](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/trail-material-is-not-in-the-renderer-tab-of-particle-system-if-gameobject-has-a-trail-and-is-a-prefab))

([UUM-812](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/removing-a-prefab-and-undoing-actions-makes-gameobject-being-unable-to-be-dragged-into-project-view))

*   WebGL: Allowed "Name Files As Hashes" option for WebGL Development builds. ([UUM-1133](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/name-files-as-hashes-doesnt-work-when-building-a-development-build-player-on-the-webgl-platform))
