## 2020.3.10f1 Release Notes


### Improvements
<ul>
<li><p>Asset Import: Improved overall performance of FBX files import.</p></li>
<li><p>Asset Import: Improved performance of ASCII FBX files import.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphics: Optimized static batching process, e.g. entering play mode with 30k static batched objects in the editor is faster by two seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphics: Static batching and Mesh.CombineMeshes can handle more vertex formats now, for example Float16 normals or UVs. It also no longer clamps vertex colors to UNorm8 format - if input meshes have higher precision vertex colors, then combined mesh will have high precision colors too. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assertion-triggered-by-mesh-dot-combinemeshes-when-underlying-meshs-vertex-format-has-changed">1274815</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>macOS: Updated xcode project template to use "modern" build system. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/macos-xcode-legacy-build-system-will-be-removed-when-future-xcode-version-is-released">1326316</a>)</p></li>
</ul>

### Changes
