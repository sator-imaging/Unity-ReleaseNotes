https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.17

## 2020.3.17f1 Release Notes


### Features
<ul>
<li>Android: Added more complete support for running Android apps on the Chrome OS platform. These changes enable building and running Android on x86 and x86-64 CPUs, now officially supported on Chrome OS devices. These changes also include input-related and windowing improvements for Chrome OS.</li>
</ul>

### Improvements
<ul>
<li><p>Android: Added boot-config/command-line switch "platform-android-cpucapacity-threshold" that can be used to specify which CPU cores are treated as big cores. The cpu capacity is a value in the range between 0 and 1024. A capacity value of 870 yields the same behavior as before the fix for case 1349057.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphics: Improve Line/TrailRenderer quality when points are close together. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linerenderer-does-not-render-lines-straight-when-positions-are-under-1-or-over-1">1322317</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Graphics: Reduced the Input delay in Vulkan standalone when VSync is enabled. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/noticable-mouse-and-keyboard-input-delay-on-a-vulkan-standalone-build-when-vsync-is-enabled">1282463</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Package: Update Addressables to 1.18.9 and SBP to 1.19.0</p></li>
<li><p>Particles: Optimize Mesh data stripping vertex channels that are used by particle systems when the mesh is included in assetbundles. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/addressables-vertex-data-is-lost-when-mesh-is-marked-as-addressable-and-play-mode-script-is-set-to-use-existing-build-1">1313420</a>)</p></li>
</ul>

### API Changes
<ul>
<li><p>Asset Bundles: Added: Adding new API DownloadHandlerAssetBundle.autoLoadAssetBundle for loading AssetBundles asynchronously from DownloadHandlerAssetBundle.</p></li>
<li><p>Services: Added: Added new com.unity.services.core package that is used for common behaviour of Game Service packages</p></li>
<li><p>XR: Added: Added IUnityGraphicsVulkanV2 plugin interface to add support for chaining vulkan initialization intercepts. (1349908)</p></li>
</ul>

### Changes
<ul>
<li><p>Graphics: Update SRP Packages to 10.6.0</p></li>
<li><p>XR: The Oculus XR Plugin package has been updated to 1.10.0.</p></li>
<li><p>XR: Updated XR Legacy Input Helpers to 2.1.8.</p></li>
</ul>
