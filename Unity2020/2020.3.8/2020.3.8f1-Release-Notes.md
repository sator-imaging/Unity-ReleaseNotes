### Improvements

*   Asset Pipeline: Improved performance of flushing the preload operation queue from the main thread. This can occur when accessing an operation's result on the main thread before it is completed. ([1322086](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/performance-bug-reported-by-the-dots-team-in-preloadmanager-waitforalloperationtocomplete))

### API Changes

*   Editor: Added: EditorUtility SetDefaultParentObject and ClearDefaultParentObject methods were added.

### Changes

*   Graphics: Update SRP packages to 10.5.0. See the package change log for additional information.

### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed crash when viewing Sprite Atlas. Disabled code that could potentially cause high memory use and unnecessary object loads at certain conditions. ([1330345](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1330345/))
    
*   Asset Import: Fixed an issue where materials were not allowed to be extracted into packages. ([1282867](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/couldnt-create-asset-file-error-is-thrown-when-extracting-materials-inside-packages-folder))
    
*   Asset Import: Fixed an issue where the Texture Importer secretly defaulted values to a negative. ([1204566](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/textureimporter-dot-wrapmode-returns-1-when-textures-wrap-mode-is-not-changed))
    
*   Asset Import: Fixed an issue where the Texture Preview was not updated correctly when switching from Alpha 8 format. ([1181655](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/texture-preview-doesnt-update-correctly-when-changing-formats-from-the-alpha-8-format))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where objects loaded during import in initial script refresh were not unloaded. ([1296506](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-scriptableobject-serializefield-value-set-to-default-during-the-first-import))

*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where the Unity version was no longer written to a serialized artifact files that was generated during asset importing. This caused inconsistent import results across Unity versions. For existing projects, users must either do a "Reimport All" or delete the library folder for this fix to take effect. ([1310981](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/generated-inconsistent-result-warning-when-reimporting-single-asset))
