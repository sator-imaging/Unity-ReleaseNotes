### Fixes

*   Android: Fixed app crashing when calling Cursor.visible or Cursor.SetCursor many time during a frame. ([1380363](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-addressables-player-crashes-with-a-jni-error-error-when-built-on-android))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue that deleting invalid asset paths don't throw ArgumentNullException when using Perforce as VCProvider. ([1333656](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vcs-assetdatabase-assetdatabase-dot-deleteasset-throws-an-error-if-the-path-is-invalid-when-using-perforce-as-vcs))
    
*   Core: Updated libcurl to 7.80. (1383040)
    
*   Editor: Fixed an issue that the Asset Labels UI will now be available when editing package assets providing the asset metafile can be modified. ([1335148](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/asset-labels-ui-is-not-displayed-when-asset-is-in-a-package))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed a race condition when rendering shadows for multiple lights, and using Particle Systems, Line Renderers or Trail Renderers. (1376967)
    
*   Graphics: Fixed sporadic freeze during texture upload, mainly on ARMv8 platforms. ([1345518](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mobile-unity-freezes-after-assetbundle-dot-loadasset-does-not-return))
    
*   Kernel: Fixed unintentional deletion of project assets directory by adding additional checks. ([1382446](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/fileutil-dot-deletefileordirectory-deletes-the-entire-project-folder-when-it-is-passed-a-null-value))
    
*   macOS: Fixed a bug related to creating a new Unity project inside a directory with Unicode characters. ([1377915](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/multiple-directorynotfoundexception-errors-appear-when-a-project-is-created-inside-a-directory-with-unicode-characters))
    
*   Particles: Fixed Forcefield Vortex determinism. ([1365909](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particle-system-moves-slower-in-play-mode-when-particle-system-force-field-component-is-attached))
    
*   Scripting: Fixed an exception being thrown when resolving a missing assembly because OS does not provide a Global Assembly Cache. ([1383700](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/an-unhandled-exception-is-thrown-in-the-editor-dot-log-and-console-window-when-trying-to-build-assetbundles))
    
*   Shaders: Fixed an issue where the number of skipped shader variants are now added to the shader compilation log output. (1389276)
    
*   Shaders: Fixed an OOM crash when preparing shaders with a large amount of variants (100M+) for compilation. IPreprocessShaders now processes not more than 1M variants at a time. ([1388530](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shader-stripping-crashes-when-it-gets-too-many-variants))
    
*   Shaders: Fixed incorrect errors by adding shader name to the error description when failing to compile or link GLSL shaders. (1378687)
    
*   Shaders: Fixed the output of "Compile and show code" button being capped to 2GB on Windows. ([1378000](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/on-windows-preprocessed-lit-dot-shader-file-stops-mid-line-when-file-size-is-near-or-more-than-2gb))
    
*   WebGL: Fixed a template breaking if quotation marks are used in company name or product name. ([1370946](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgl-player-is-stuck-on-the-gray-screen-when-company-name-includes-quotation-mark))
    
*   Windows: Fixed a signing issue and now 32-bit Windows standalone player binaries are signed with Unity certificate. ([1382876](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/32-bit-windows-standalone-player-binaries-are-not-signed))
