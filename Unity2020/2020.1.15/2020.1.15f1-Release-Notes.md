### System Requirements Changes

### For running Unity games

*   iOS: minimum version incremented to 10.0 (from 9.0).

### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed issue where when using Safe or Smart slicing caused some sprite rects to become parented or unselectable. ([1264701](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/2d-sprite-editor-safe-or-smart-slicing-causes-some-sprite-rects-to-become-parented-or-unselectable))
    
*   Asset Bundles: Fixed main thread hitching when loading an AssetBundle asynchronously while loading other assets in the background.
    
*   Asset Import: Fixed issue where FBX and Sketchup files with paths longer than 260 characters could not be imported on Windows. ([1283359](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/importing-fbx-files-fails-with-paths-longer-than-260-characters))
    
*   Asset Import: Fixed issue with OnAssignMaterialModel next methods not being called even when the first one returns a null object. ([1280978](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/onassignmaterialmodel-postprocessor-is-called-only-once-when-reimporting-an-fbx))
    
*   Build Pipeline: Fixed such that 'Compress Assets on Import' setting no longer gets enabled each time a player is built. ([1277242](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/compress-assets-on-import-setting-gets-enabled-each-time-a-player-is-built))
    
*   Editor: Fixed to make EditorUtility.DisplayProgressBar visible, even for async/background tasks. ([1285801](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-progress-bar-does-not-appear-after-calling-editorutility-dot-displayprogressbar))

*   Editor: Fixed Windows Editor progress bar not displaying progress overlay in the taskbar icon when the progress dialog is focused. ([1269517](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/windows-the-unity-import-progress-is-not-shown-in-the-windows-taskbar))

*   Graphics: Fixed crash with accessing invalid texture ID. (1277836)
    
*   Graphics: Fixed missing type check from VFX component sheet. ([1258022](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-vfxpropertysheetserializedcomponent-readbackfromruntime-when-opening-the-visual-effect-graph-window))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed terrain trees showing both baked and realtime shadows when using a static prefab. ([1122324](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/static-gameobjects-that-belong-in-terrain-casts-realtime-shadows))
    
*   IMGUI: Fixed an issue where Editor slowed down when ObjectSelector/ProjectBrowser had a large number of objects. ([1285342](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-performance-loss-when-selecting-an-object-in-the-select-object-window))
    
*   Kernel: Fixed to improve memory management for storing object information. ([1275751](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/allocated-memory-is-not-cleared-when-loading-and-unloading-scenes))
    
*   macOS: Fixed Mac editor/player hanging the whole OS on Apple silicon devices. ([1285304](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mac-dtk-unity-screen-freeze))
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an error being thrown when inspecting packages in the 'My Assets' section of Package Manager. ([1265358](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/an-error-is-thrown-when-inspecting-packages-in-the-my-assets-section-of-package-manager))
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed to ensure that at Unity shutdown time, we do not crash if a user keeps sending progress report. ([1282030](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-editor-progress-progressmanager-removemainthread-when-closing-the-editor))
    
*   Particles: Fixed an issue where procedural emission was being capped incorrectly leading to burst emission in excess of the Max Particles limit. ([1285328](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particles-prewarm-can-exceed-max-particles-limit))
    
*   Particles: Fixed to limit the rendering cache size to avoid using lots of memory when using multiple cameras. (1270438)

### System Requirements

### For development

#### OS: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.12+. (Server versions of Windows & OS X are not tested.)

#### CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.

#### GPU: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.

#### The rest mostly depends on the complexity of your projects.

### Additional platform development requirements:

*   iOS: Mac computer running minimum macOS 10.12.6 and Xcode 9.0 or higher.
    
*   Android: Android SDK and Java Development Kit (JDK); IL2CPP scripting backend requires Android NDK.

    *   Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
    *   CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.
*   iOS player requires iOS 10.0 or higher.
    
*   Android: OS 4.4 or later; ARMv7 CPU with NEON support; OpenGL ES 2.0 or later.
    
*   WebGL: Any recent desktop version of Firefox, Chrome, Edge or Safari.
