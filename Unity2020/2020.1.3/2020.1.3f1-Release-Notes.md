### System Requirements Changes

### For running Unity games

*   iOS: minimum version incremented to 10.0 (from 9.0).

### Fixes

*   Asset Bundles: Fixed an edge case with AssetBundle.Contains not returning true for case sensitive paths. ([1253270](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assetbundle-dot-contains-does-not-find-aseets-when-bundles-are-built-using-compatibilitybuildpipeline-dot-buildassetbundles))
    
*   Editor: Context menus that are deeper than root level are not removed. ([1263906](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-mono-method-signature-checked-when-selecting-a-context-menu-option-that-has-been-removed-from-code))
    
*   Editor: Fixed Screen.resolutions returning 0 length collection in the Linux editor ([1200397](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-editor-available-screens-are-not-detected-with-screen-dot-resolutions))
    
*   Editor: Fixed the issue with Foldout click rect not aligning with the icon. ([1244058](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/foldout-click-area-does-not-align-with-the-foldout-arrow-image))
    
*   GI: Fixed lightmappers carrying over stale state when switching scenes. ([1244384](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-with-empty-stacktrace-when-starting-bake-in-the-new-scene-after-baking-previous-scene-with-gpu-plm))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed missing memory barrier when image is repeatedly bound for writing between dispatch calls.
    
*   Graphics: Prevent memory leak of Command Buffers on Metal devices. (1266209)
    
*   iOS: Fixed storyboards sometimes still rotating to forbidden orientations on iOS 13+ ([1266961](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-storyboard-shows-in-landscape-orientation-for-a-second-even-though-auto-rotation-only-allows-portrait-orientations))
    
*   Mobile: Adaptive Performance - Added workaround to send temperature warning when the device starts as warm already as currently no events are sent.
    
*   Mobile: Adaptive Performance - Automatic Performance Mode: lower CPU and GPU levels at the same time instead of one at a time to increase efficiency and higher power savings.
    
*   Mobile: Adaptive Performance - Fixed Automatic Performance Control flag to respect the function and not be read only anymore.
    
*   Mobile: Adaptive Performance - Thermal Mitigation Logic changes in GameSDK 3.2 and it was updated in SetFreqLevels() to react to the correct return values.
    
*   Physics: Ensured that multi-threaded 2D physics solver handles contact response the same as the non-multi-threaded one. Fix bug where contact masses were different. ([1267509](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/physics2d-multithreading-not-behaving-as-expected))
    
*   Physics: Fixed an issue where a Cloth components external acceleration would be applied in local space instead of world space ([1221805](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cloth-external-acceleration-is-applied-in-local-space-instead-of-world-space))
    
*   Physics: Fixed an issue where a Cloth components penetration constraint's would be influenced by the Transforms scale, resulting in incorrect behavior ([1215212](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/spheres-cloth-explodes-slash-rotates-and-constraints-disappear-only-one-is-left-when-entering-play-mode))
    
*   Physics: Fixed an issue where adding Colliders via the inspector to a Cloth component would not register when done in Play Mode ([1260337](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cloth-sphere-colliders-have-no-effect-when-they-are-added-during-runtime))
    
*   Physics: Fixed an issue where providing a null mesh to a previously authored Cloth component, would not clear the constraints causing the inspector to throw (1217772)
    
*   Physics: Fixed Cloth components Reset functionality to properly reset all data, including colliders, virtual particle weights and self-inter collision indices ([1263702](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cloth-reset-functionality-doesnt-work-for-the-capsule-colliders-and-sphere-colliders-under-the-cloth-component))
    
*   Prefabs: Fixed crash when opening scene with broken prefabs ([1261297](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-crashes-on-anchoredjoint2d-configuredistance-when-loading-a-specific-scene))
    
*   Profiler: Optimized frame stats calculation when selecting a sample in Profiler Window. ([967289](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/performance-issue-in-profiler-ui-with-increasing-number-of-events))
    
*   UI: Fixed the issue where the vertices were not stripped for rich text in multi line ([1182818](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vertices-for-richtext-markups-do-not-get-stripped-if-the-text-does-not-fit-in-a-single-line))
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Fixed TouchScreenKeyboard not setting Text on HoloLens2 ([1246744](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/system-keyboard-have-to-press-delete-twice-for-it-to-work))
    
*   Windows: Fixed HID devices for NewInput failing to initialize in x86 builds ([1188222](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/windows-ds4-controller-doesnt-work-in-built-scene))
    
*   XR: Fixed for crash when passing empty string to TryGetFeatureValue ([1225985](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/xr-passing-a-default-struct-to-inputdevice-dot-trygetfeaturevalue-crashes-the-editor-when-enter-play-mode-in-vr))
    
*   XR: Fixed Input System always executing XR buttons in LateUpdate
    

### Changes

*   Mobile: Adaptive Performance - Automatic Performance Control does not lower CPU lower than 1 on GameSDK 3.2 workaround.
    
*   Mobile: Adaptive Performance - Automatic Performance Mode: gpuFactor increased from 0.72 to 0.92 to increase effeciency.
    
*   Mobile: Adaptive Performance - Automatic Performance Mode: gpuUtilizationThreshold increased from 0.7 to 0.9 to increase effeciency.
    
*   Mobile: Adaptive Performance - Automatic Performance Mode: Increase GPU Active time Ratio.
    
*   Mobile: Adaptive Performance - Changed Documentation to make clear that changing CPU and GPU levels is risky and the Automatic Performance Mode should be used instead.
    
*   Mobile: Adaptive Performance - Exchanged GameSDK wrapper with updated version removing GameSDK 3.1 support.
    
*   Mobile: Adaptive Performance - Upgraded to Subsystem Registry 1.1.0 which bumps min version of Adaptive Performance to 2019.4
    
*   XR: Updated Windows Mixed Reality verified package to version 3.3.1.
    

### Improvements

*   iOS: Improved dynamic resolution performance for iOS 13, macOS 15 and tvOS 13. ([1252731](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-13-command-buffer-injection-adds-gpu-fences-to-command-graph-on-ios-in-2019-dot-3))

### System Requirements

### For development

#### OS: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.12+. (Server versions of Windows & OS X are not tested.)

#### CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.

#### GPU: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.

#### The rest mostly depends on the complexity of your projects.

### Additional platform development requirements:
