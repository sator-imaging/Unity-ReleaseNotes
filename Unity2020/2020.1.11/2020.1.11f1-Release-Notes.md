### System Requirements Changes

### For running Unity games

*   iOS: minimum version incremented to 10.0 (from 9.0).

### Fixes

*   Android: Fixed error when exporting Gradle project that contains .aar files to the same location. ([1246663](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unable-to-export-aar-file-more-than-once-in-an-android-project))
    
*   Android: Fixed memory leak when using obb. ([1207718](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-usage-increases-while-switching-application-to-background-and-back-when-obb-expansion-files-are-used-in-the-project))
    
*   Android: Fixed screen keyboard not showing up on Android 11, when input field is hidden. Previously input field was placed out of bounds of window when hidden, but due behavioral changes in Android 11, this was no longer a valid way. The input field will be made completely transparent now when input field is requested to be hidden. ([1258071](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-keyboard-doesnt-show-up-when-trying-to-input-text-in-an-input-field-with-hide-mobile-input-checked-on-android-11))
    
*   Animation: Fixed a Playmode crash in the Editor that happens after modifying scripts while animating certain UI Components using the Animation Component. ([1238859](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-with-various-stack-traces-when-exiting-play-mode-after-recompiling-scripts))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed assert in loaded asset management - 'it->second.IsValid() that could get triggered for default imported assets. ([1268154](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/asset-import-errors-thrown-on-creating-a-project-using-microgame-templates))
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed for RefreshProfiler reporting numbers not aligned with log text. (1281837)
    
*   Editor: Fixed to preserve meta file info when drag-copying assets in the Project Window. ([1276574](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ctrl-plus-drag-or-option-plus-drag-on-an-asset-with-unsaved-changes-will-copy-an-asset-without-the-unsaved-changes))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed such that draw calls done in script are now displayed correctly when the Frame Debugger is connected to remote players. ([1261959](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mobile-draw-mesh-instanced-is-not-showed-in-frame-debbuger-on-mobile-devices))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed terrain reverting to builtin material after having been upgraded using URP upgrader. ([1204189](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/project-crashes-when-trying-to-re-generate-tree-materials-after-upgrade-to-urp))
    
*   IL2CPP: Corrected the behavior of UnityEngine.Mathf methods when invoked via a delegate for WebGL players. ([1252289](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgl-application-crashes-when-mathf-methods-are-passed-as-func-parameter))
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed an issue with crashes on IL2CPP player startup, related to some network configurations (VPNs). (1242001)
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed thread names on Android. ([1272098](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-il2cpp-forked-threads-from-unitymain-inherit-its-properties-including-the-name))
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed to avoid calling a default constructor during marshaling for reference types that are not out parameters. ([1263916](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-managed-code-stripping-strips-a-parameterless-constructor-from-a-managed-dll-when-using-il2cpp-scripting-backend))
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed to avoid emitting C# comments into the generated C code stream when source code annotations are enabled. ([1251077](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-mobile-project-does-not-build-to-il2cpp-if-one-of-the-scripts-has-korean-symbols-in-the-comments))
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed to enforce the --maximum-recursive-generic-depth command line option at run time. ([1276405](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-nested-generic-limit-error-is-thrown-when-using-sprache-and-increasing-the-limit-does-not-work))

*   Particles: Fixed particles having incorrect bounds after calling Play when the system contained user-provided particles via SetParticles. ([1273773](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particle-bounds-are-displayed-incorrectly-until-a-change-is-made-in-the-particle-system-when-the-particles-are-generated-by-code))
    
*   Physics: Added an icon for the ArticulationBody component. ([1201422](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/articulation-body-does-not-have-an-icon))
    
*   Physics: Fixed an issue with the cloth component where increasing/decreasing frame-rate would affect the forces given to the simulation. ([1255801](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cloth-component-behavior-is-altered-when-the-frame-rate-changes))
    
*   Physics: Fixed an issue with the cloth simulation where setting the time scale to a floating point value close to zero and back to one, would cause additional force to be applied. ([1181701](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cloth-simulation-is-not-natural-when-time-scale-is-changed-from-one-thats-close-to-zero-to-1))
    
*   Physics: Updated Scripting API documentation for SwapBodies. ([1154942](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/anchor-and-connectedanchor-gizmos-are-shown-in-incorrect-position-when-swap-bodies-in-configurable-joint-is-active))
    
*   Prefabs: Fixed prefab merging when managed reference instances have been changed. ([1237191](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prefab-changes-are-not-applied-and-an-error-occurs-when-changing-fields-that-have-serializereference-attribute))
    
*   Profiler: Fixed Profiler Overview information blinking when moving the playhead around while searching in the Module details panel. ([1276873](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/profiler-overview-information-is-blinking-when-moving-the-playhead-around-while-searching-in-the-module-details-panel))

*   Shaders: Reduced memory consumption of Caching preprocessor by a factor of 2 on large shaders. ([1278110](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/memory-usage-spikes-to-8-gb-causes-machines-with-8-gb-ram-or-lower-the-editor-to-freeze-when-building-creator-kit-fps))
    
*   Terrain: Fixed such that undoing after removing terrain layer correctly restores alphamaps. ([1276283](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/terrain-paint-layers-removing-layer-in-the-middle-of-stack-and-then-undoing-changes-all-other-layers))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed PropertyField for Array types in the Inspector to allow customized label value on the Foldout. ([1214572](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/uielements-visual-elements-propertys-label-cannot-be-changed-when-it-is-an-array))
    
*   Version Control: Fixed a crash when trying to connect to a Perforce workspace that doesn't exist. ([1275466](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unity-crashes-when-connecting-to-a-perforce-server-with-an-invalid-workspace-name-in-the-project-settings))
