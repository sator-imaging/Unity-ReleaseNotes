### System Requirements Changes

### For running Unity games

*   iOS: minimum version incremented to 10.0 (from 9.0).

### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed dynamic batching for TilemapRenderer in Individual mode with SpriteRenderers when Sprites have secondary textures set. ([1277223](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/tilemap-renderer-in-individual-mode-does-not-batch-with-other-sprite-renderers))
    
*   2D: Fixed totalSpriteSurfaceArea to get reserialized when switching build platforms. ([1273235](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-spriteatlas-totalspritesurfacearea-get-reserialized-when-switching-build-platforms))
    
*   AI: Fixed an issue where CreateLocation does not return correct projection of an input point on an OffMeshLink. ([1246726](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/navmeshquery-dot-createlocation-always-returns-the-same-point-when-using-a-navmeshlink-polygon-even-if-the-width-is-0))
    
*   Android: Fixed to enable Unity perform Android SDK update with elevated privileges on Windows. Previously if Android SDK/NDK would be installed in folder like Program Files, Unity wouldn't be able to update Android SDK. With new behavior user will be prompted with a dialog where Unity will ask - if it can run sdkmanager.bat with elevated privileges. (1281951)
    
*   Asset Import: Fixed such that substance files do not display an import warning anymore when the substance plugin is correctly set up in a new project. ([1221240](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/substance-designer-material-support-warnings-are-thrown-on-project-load-even-when-the-plugin-is-installed))
    
*   Audio: Fixed to synchronize audio source playing state with timeline clip playing state. ([1146694](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/audiosource-dot-isplaying-is-set-to-false-when-audio-is-being-played-through-a-playable-director))
    
*   Audio: Fixed to unblock streaming mp3 on supported platforms. ([1224487](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/streaming-of-mp3-files-is-not-supported-when-pc-mac-and-linux-standalone-platform-is-selected))
    
*   Editor: Fixed -api-profile flag causing editor to write to ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset using binary serialization mode despite ForceText being configured in ProjectSettings/EditorSettings.asset.
    
*   Editor: Fixed a crash that could occur when Burst compilation was scheduled before Burst had been initialized.
    
*   Editor: Fixed incorrect error message in audio importer. ([1279810](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unknown-platform-passed-to-audioimporter-error-is-thrown-when-selecting-an-audio-file-and-uwp-support-is-installed))
    
*   Editor: Fixed incorrect key values being passed to the new input system on Linux. ([1275964](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inputsystem-not-mapping-keyboard-keys-properly-on-linux))
    
*   Editor: Fixed to unblock streaming mp3 when targeting webgl. ([1252868](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/platform-not-supported-error-is-thrown-when-trying-to-play-an-mp3-file-in-editor-with-build-platform-set-to-webgl))
    
*   GI: Fixed an error log message in the light conversion script that could occur when light colors produced denormalized floats. Light without any color channel exceeding 1e-20 will be treated as completely black (0,0,0). ([1275179](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/out-of-range-0-1-exceptions-are-thrown-when-light-component-intensity-value-is-lower-than-3-dot-79684775648568885e-38))
    
*   GI: Fixed an issue where Enlighten would run on build despite being disabled. (1258154)
    
*   Graphics: Fixed an issue where in some cases, Custom Render Textures would not be rendered (generally with asset bundles or in a standalone build). ([1281400](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-customrendertexture-does-not-render-on-android-devices-when-the-shader-in-use-is-created-from-the-documentation))
    
*   Package Manager: FIxed the Assets > Properties window to display a selected package's display name instead of the id in the title tab. ([1217758](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/imgui-window-names-for-package-properties-is-not-user-friendly-when-opened-from-assets-properties))
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed the crash due to a corrupted ProjectCache.bin that could occur when opening a project last opened in a different Unity Editor version. ([1276565](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-crashes-when-upgrading-slash-downgrading-between-2020-dot-1-and-2020-dot-2))
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed VW being unable to see Unity packages since they access them from a server that is not on unity.com domain. (1274555)
    
*   Particles: Fixed missing Trail Material slot in the Inspector. ([1284719](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particles-cant-set-trail-material))
    
*   Prefabs: Fixed crashes caused by broken scenes, where missing prefabs have been serialized badly into the scene file. ([1280054](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-gameobject-activateawakerecursivelyinternal-when-enabling-a-broken-prefab))
    
*   Prefabs: Fixed editor crashes caused by prefabs instance with missing assets. ([1219109](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/clicking-on-any-game-object-in-the-scene-view-crashes-the-editor))
    
*   Prefabs: Fixed Editor crashes/hangs when using PrefabUtillity.SetPropertyModifications() where some propertymodification.target are invalid (null). (1276769)
    
*   Prefabs: Fixed such that managed field types in prefabs containing Arrays are now serialized correctly to allow field to be initialized before Array.size is set. (1255012)
    
*   Profiler: Fixed such that the UI System Preview Window in the UI Profiler module now has its title set correctly. ([1238881](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/profiler-ui-system-preview-window-title-is-not-user-friendly))
    
*   Serialization: Fixed to make sure that when objects are created as part of a deserialization process the class default initializers are called. ([1253433](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/serializereference-non-serialized-fields-with-default-initializers-become-null-after-entering-playmode))
    
*   Services: Added a fix for the removal of CEF from the editor causing an exception when a tracker is added to a game object.  
    The removal of CEF meant that when analytics is not enabled, and you add an analytics tracker to a game object, the library  
    required to create the "go to service menu and enable analytics" button didn't exist, and thus would throw an exception. The solution was  
    to have a seperate class initialised on load that would override this functionality for all editors that don't have this library. (1277664)
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Fixed a crash which happens when rapidly switching between input fields with text in them. ([1278859](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/uwp-build-crashes-when-changing-focus-of-input-field-with-text-in-it))
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Fixed excessive memory usage when application gets suspended. (1279629)
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Fixed Y coordinate on new input system when running on non-100% scaled display. ([1278638](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mouse-position-on-y-axis-on-uwp-is-broken-when-display-scaling-is-set-to-non-100-percent-scaling))
    
*   Version Control: Fixed an issue where duplicate keys could cause empty data to be output, and improved transform mapping to work with a wider range of Unity versions. ([1258865](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unityyamlmerge-generates-an-empty-prefab-when-merging-a-custom-prefab-with-itself))
    
*   Video: Fixed to use 2d spatial blending when playing audio in direct mode. ([1276611](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/videoplayer-plays-sound-in-mono-when-audio-output-mode-is-set-to-direct-and-the-video-playing-has-2-channels))
