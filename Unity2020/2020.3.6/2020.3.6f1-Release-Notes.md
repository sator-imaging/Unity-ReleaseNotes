*   UI Elements: Fixed the inability to launch the editor in clamped GLES 3.0 and 3.1 mode. Also, it is now possible to use UIToolkit on GLES 3.0 and 3.1 devices that do not support float render textures. ([1311845](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/uir-r32g32b32a32-sfloat-not-supported-on-opengl-es-3-dot-0-and-3-dot-1))

*   XR: Fixed an issue where XRDisplaySubsystem and XRInputSubsystem were not available on WebGL build target. (1283105)
    
*   XR: Fixed deadlock when using XR + URP + D3D11 with skipPresentToMainScreen. ([1323833](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/openxr-plus-urp-plus-uwp-rendering-stuck))
    
*   XR: Fixed issue where shadows would jitter while rotating a camera at an extreme distance from the origin of the scene in mono rendering. ([1281930](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shadows-flickering-when-scene-is-offset-from-origin-and-camera-has-a-low-near-clip-plane))
