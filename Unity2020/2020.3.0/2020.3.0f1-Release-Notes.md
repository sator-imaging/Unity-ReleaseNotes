<li><p>UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where use cases for SerializedObject bindings would cause the Editor to crash. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/serializereference-editor-crashes-when-creating-a-graphview-node-after-deleting-a-graphview-node-with-serializedproperty">1305198</a>)</p></li>
