### Fixes

*   Asset Import: Fixed a rare unstable asset hash for assets with large metadata. ([1285620](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/consistency-checker-logs-say-that-import-results-are-inconsistent-for-textures))
    
*   Audio: Fixed a DSPGraph/Burst player crash. ([1297730](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dspgraph-playclip-sample-crashes-in-windows-slash-x64-build))
    
*   Editor: Fixed a ReorderableList GC issue due to registry usage. (1315466)
    
*   Editor: Fixed issue on Windows where mouse pointer did not hide while in Play mode. ([1273522](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-cursor-dot-visible-equals-false-does-not-work-when-inputsystem-package-is-installed))
    
*   Graphics: A CopyDepth pass was previously included which allowed users script access to \_CameraDepthTarget but this has been removed on the metal GPU families that use Tile-based renderers (iOS, Silicon-GPU), fixed the performance decrease that caused this ([1298799](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-copydepth-pass-is-present-in-the-legacy-deferred-render-pipeline-and-results-in-extra-render-target-memory-and-gpu-time))
    
*   macOS: Fixed a code signing issue of native plugins in Xcode projects. ([1276317](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/xcode-macos-bundle-plugins-are-not-signed-in-xcode-projects))
    
*   macOS: Fixed an issue when exported macOS Standalone player builds were refusing to launch and showing "<Unity app> was damaged and could not be opened" error when downloaded from the internet. ([1304455](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/macos-builds-now-contain-a-quarantine-attribute))
    
*   Scene Manager: Fixed a crash when the asset of a current opened scene had been deleted, a new scene asset was imported, with same GUID, and the user choose "reload". ([1309393](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/freeze-or-crash-on-editorscenemanager-reloadscene-when-importing-an-asset-and-reloading-the-opened-scene))
    
*   Scripting: Fixed an issue when Application.quitting event was not raised when application was terminated from the OS side. ([1309540](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/application-dot-quitting-event-is-not-raised-when-closing-build))
    
*   Scripting: Validate cyclic dependencies on assembly definition update ([1293762](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/exception-thrown-instead-of-error-when-creating-assembly-with-cyclic-reference))
    
*   Serialization: Fixed a crash when using JSONUtility to deserialize objects that had Serialized References. ([1296236](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/jsonutility-deserialization-corrupted-values))
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed an issue where use cases for SerializedObject bindings would cause the Editor to crash. ([1305198](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/serializereference-editor-crashes-when-creating-a-graphview-node-after-deleting-a-graphview-node-with-serializedproperty))
    

### Changes

*   Graphics: Update SRP packages to 10.3.2 ([1298466](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/visual-effect-graph-infinite-compilation-when-opening), [1309219](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/shadergraph-undeclared-identifier-unitybuildtexture2dstructnoscale-errors-when-using-a-sample-texture-2d-node-in-a-vfx-sg))

### System Requirements

### For development

#### OS: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.13+. (Server versions of Windows & OS X are not tested.)

#### CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.

#### GPU: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.

#### The rest mostly depends on the complexity of your projects.

### Additional platform development requirements:

*   iOS: Mac computer running minimum macOS 10.13+ and Xcode 9.0 or higher.
    
*   Android: Android SDK and Java Development Kit (JDK); IL2CPP scripting backend requires Android NDK.
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 (64-bit), Visual Studio 2015 with C++ Tools component or later and Windows 10 SDK
    

### For running Unity games

*   Desktop:
    
    *   OS: Windows 7 SP1+, macOS 10.13+, Ubuntu 18.04+
    *   Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
    *   CPU: SSE2 instruction set support.
*   iOS player requires iOS 11.0 or higher.
    
*   Android: OS 4.4 or later; ARMv7 CPU with NEON support; OpenGL ES 2.0 or later.
    
*   WebGL: Any recent desktop version of Firefox, Chrome, Edge or Safari.
    
*   Universal Windows Platform: Windows 10 and a graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities
    
*   Exported Android Gradle projects require Android Studio 3.4 and later to build
