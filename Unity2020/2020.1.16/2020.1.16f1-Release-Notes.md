### System Requirements Changes

### For running Unity games

*   iOS: minimum version incremented to 10.0 (from 9.0).

### Fixes

*   Build Pipeline: Fixed such that SerializeReference instance types are now preserved when setting Player.Optimization.Managed Stripping Level to Medium or High. ([1232785](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unitylinker-strips-classes-used-with-the-serializereference-attribute))
    
*   Build Pipeline: Fixed such that StreamingAssets AssetBundle manifest is now provided by default to PlayerBuild, which will result in types being referred by AssetBundle being kept in the build even if Player.Optimization.Managed Stripping Level is set to Medium or High.
    
*   GI: Fixed such that TextureImporter now chooses the ETC2 format instead of PVRTC for directional lightmaps by default when build target is iOS. ([1235359](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-directional-lightmap-compression-causes-lightmap-artifacts))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed crash when optimizing Mesh which contains overlapped indices in sub meshes. ([1288561](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-when-optimizing-mesh-which-contains-overlapped-indices-in-sub-meshes))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed frame debugger not showing correct keywords when stage-specific shader features are used. ([1261620](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/frame-debugger-does-not-show-all-keywords-used-by-the-shader-when-certain-shader-feature-directives-are-used))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed separate samplers support for Nintendo Switch.
    
*   Graphics: Fixed SRP not firing visibility callbacks when an object is indirectly became visible due to shadow culling. ([1286377](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/assertion-failed-on-expression-errors-when-switching-shared-mesh-rapidly))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed unstable mip streaming tests. (1188754)
    
*   Graphics: Updated SRP packages to 8.3.1.
    
*   iOS: Fixed builtin deferred renderer using 2 extra encoders to just clear GBuffer. ([1277009](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/metal-ios-shadowmask-lighting-causes-two-extra-load-slash-store-actions-when-deferred-renderer-is-used))
    
*   iOS: Fixed such that Arcade's application is using a prohibited API when using Social API function.
    
*   Package: Updated the Post-processing package to version 3.0.1.
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed issues when using Unity Package Manager on Intel's 10th generation processor. ([1238432](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cannot-connect-to-local-package-manager-server-error-is-thrown-when-using-custom-registry-packages-with-10th-generation-intel))
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed the issue where PackageList have null ref errors when domain reload happens during Asset Store list request.
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed the issue where refresh in Asset Store tab would not fit the page.
    
*   Profiler: Fixed a race condition in the Shadow Casters stat, which can cause inconsistent collection of the stat. (1265648)
    
*   Scripting: Fixed crash during Domain Reloads after modifying scripts. ([1262671](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crashes-on-mono-class-init-when-entering-play-mode-after-recompiling-scripts))
    
*   Scripting: Fixed Version Defines not being taken into account by the Define Constraints in the Asmdef inspector. ([1285024](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/packages-unity-tests-framework-constraint-shows-error-when-added))
    
*   Shaders: Fixed native metal shaders failing to import when using caching preprocessor. (1284963)
    
*   Shaders: Fixed options not being parsed for multi\_compile\_instancing when using caching preprocessor. ([1285968](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-graphics-dot-drawmeshinstanced-does-not-render-an-instance))
    
*   Shaders: Fixed out of bounds access to static const arrays in generated GLSL code. ([1276781](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/opengl-slash-gles-static-const-vector-returns-incorrect-data))
    
*   Text: Fixed IME getting permanently disabled on focus and / or context change. ([1091254](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/korean-symbols-can-not-be-typed-into-gui-dot-textarea-korean-ime-is-disabled))
    
*   XR: Fixed such that Lumin builds no longer needlessly package pre-compiled managed DLLs into the final MPK. ([1233875](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/lumin-il2cpp-converted-c-number-dlls-are-copied-to-the-build-file))
    
*   XR: Fixed such that Lumin builds now properly include source plugins when building the IL2CPP library. ([1218580](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/lumin-building-for-lumin-ignores-raw-c-or-cpp-plugin-files))
    
*   XR: Fixed VSync not displaying in profiler when VR enabled. ([1114382](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vr-vsync-is-not-displayed-in-the-profiler-when-running-with-vr-enabled))
