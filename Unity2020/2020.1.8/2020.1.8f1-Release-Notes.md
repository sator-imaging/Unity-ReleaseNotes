### System Requirements Changes

### For running Unity games

*   iOS: minimum version incremented to 10.0 (from 9.0).

### Fixes

*   Asset Import: Fixed an issue throwing errors in the console when changing Rig settings of multiple models at once. ([1272865](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nullreferenceexception-error-is-thrown-when-more-than-one-avatar-is-selected-and-their-avatars-info-is-updated))
    
*   Build Pipeline: Fixed regression crash with serialized PropertyName field. ([1267271](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/building-a-project-crashes-when-a-script-component-has-serialized-array-of-a-type-that-contains-a-serialized-propertyname-field))
    
*   Editor: Fixed materials not getting reverted back when performing drag along with other asset types using ProBuilder face selection. ([1260931](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/last-touched-by-the-drag-and-drop-action-object-is-painted-when-drag-dropping-a-material-onto-a-probuilder-face-selection))
    
*   Editor: Fixed MinMaxCurve and MinMaxGradient dropdown style to match other dropdown styles(bigger icon). ([1267276](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particlesystemforce-properties-dropdown-icons-present-under-particle-system-force-field-are-not-user-friendly))
    
*   Editor: Fixed new input system mouse coordinate scaling in editor play mode on Linux. ([1252149](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mouse-position-values-reported-as-half-of-thier-actual-values-in-screen-pixels-when-display-scaling-is-set-to-200-percent))
    
*   Editor: Fixed the issue with an infinite loop while loading editor layout. ([1275270](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/window-layout-cannot-load-editor-layout-stuck-in-infinite-loop-of-failed-to-load-window-layout))
    
*   Editor: Fixed to allow multithreaded graphics in the Linux editor when using Vulkan. ([1252387](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-frame-debugger-can-not-be-enabled-and-asks-for-multi-threaded-renderer-to-be-enabled-even-when-its-forced-on))
    
*   GI: Fixed a synchronization issue that caused GI bakes to never complete when using the GPU lightmapper on MacOS. ([1204412](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unable-to-bake-after-switching-lightmapper-a-few-times))
    
*   GI: Fixed Sphere.IsInside. ([1271048](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-directional-light-artefacts-in-2020-dot-2-0a21))
    
*   Graphics: Improved objects sorting when scene contains both GameObject & Hybrid rendered entities. (1270315)
    
*   iOS: Fixed crash on UnityPause/UnityIsPaused when called with unity runtime not inited. ([1278746](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-unityispaused-slash-unitypause-causing-the-app-to-crash-when-called-after-unity-was-shut-down))
    
*   iOS: Fixed memory corruption under rare circumstances. ([1256815](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/getting-a-heap-corruption-crash-in-a-malloc-at-boot-time))
    
*   iOS: Fixed rare osver/device dependent crash on exit, when \[UIViewController viewWillTransitionToSize:withTransitionCoordinator:\] is called on killing unity view. (1278124)
    
*   Kernel: Fixed player connection to PS4 when using it IP. (1275104)
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed preview packages from Scoped Registries to no longer be filtered out.
    
*   Particles: Improved performance when using Rigidbody velocity mode. Previously a search for a valid Rigidbody was made every update, we now only perform the search once and cache the result. (1268442)
    
*   Physics: Fixed editor crash on AnchoredJoint2D::ConfigureAnchors when opening a scene containing GameObject with Joints but without Rigidbody. ([1272231](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-anchoredjoint2d-configureanchors-when-opening-a-scene-containing-gameobject-with-joints-but-without-rigidbodies))
    
*   Serialization: Improved performance applying Prefab changes to TileMap. ([1239162](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/performance-regression-editoronly-prefabs-dot-mergeprefabs-process-noticeably-slower-when-opening-a-scene))
    
*   Shaders: Fixed "pos == inputBuffer.size()" errors when fetching compute shader data from accelerator server. (1229986)
    
*   XR: Fixed SRP batcher activation with XR multipass rendering.
    
*   XR: Improved Vulkan memory usage with offscreen swapchains. ([1278553](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/xr-vulkan-oculus-crash-in-hybrid-renderer-beginrenderpass))
