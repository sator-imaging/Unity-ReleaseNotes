## 2020.3.12f1 Release Notes


### Improvements
<ul>
<li><p>IL2CPP: Correctly provide the source file hash so that a managed debugger can determine when a source file has changed and provide a proper warning.</p></li>
<li><p>Particles: Add support for copy/paste of entire modules via the module header context menu. (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/particle-system-module-values-are-not-copied-when-right-clicking-and-selecting-copy-option">1314490</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Profiler: Added missing memory labels sizes to the memory snapshot format, in order to give real value to the prexisting label list. Api for access this data will be found inside the memory profiler package</p></li>
<li><p>Profiler: Added profiler memory stats data, data is similar to the Profiler Module data found in the Profiler Window</p></li>
<li><p>Profiler: Added profiler target data to memory snapshot format, data consists of elements such as unity version, product name, total gfx memory, total physical memory etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Profiler: Encoded managed heap section type inside the snapshot format, for retrieval via the memory profiler package</p></li>
<li><p>Profiler: Reworked native connection reporting for the memory profiler in order to properly report connections between assets</p></li>
</ul>

### API Changes
<ul>
<li>Services: Changed: On some platforms the Analytics modules are completely stripped out.  Any user code that references anything from Analytics will not compile on these platforms.   The documentation was updated to inform users of the need to #ifdef this code out for this situation. (1333730)</li>
</ul>
