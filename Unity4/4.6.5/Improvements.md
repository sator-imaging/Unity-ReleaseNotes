# Unity 4.6.5
https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-4.6.5

## Improvements

<ul>
<li>Android: Apply DeviceDefault theme if available, respect user's theme.</li>
<li>Animation: Better formatting of the error message when animation events are fired (i.e: "oldWrappedTime &gt; newWrappedTime").</li>
<li>UI: Allow dragging anchors outside of bounds of parent when holding down Ctrl (Cmd on Mac) - the same key that disables snapping. This makes it easier to author screen transitions that support multiple resolutions, since content can be animated to move a distance that's a percentage of the screen width or height.</li>
<li>UI: Avoid rebatching when moving a Nested Canvas.</li>
</ul>
