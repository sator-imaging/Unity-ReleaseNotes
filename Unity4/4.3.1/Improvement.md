## Improvement



*   Windows Store Apps/Windows 8.1: When using debug player, more information will be outputed to Output Window, for ex., WindowsActivate, WindowsSizeChanged events, etc
*   Windows Store Apps: Restore CompilationOverrides.UseNetCore option behavior like it was in 4.2.x, basically if you have this option - all C# files will be compiled against .NET Core, also introduced a new option UseNetCorePartially which compiles C# against .NET Core if they're not located in - Plugins, Standard Assets or Pro Standard Assets directories.
