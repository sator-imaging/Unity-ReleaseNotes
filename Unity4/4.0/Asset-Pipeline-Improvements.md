## Asset Pipeline Improvements

<ul>
<li>Added userData string property to AssetImporter, use this to pass per asset data to asset post processor.</li>
<li>Manual asset reimport (via context menu) always reimports, even if cache server already has the result.</li>
<li>Optimized file system performance of asset imports. Library/cache and Library/previews folders are gone; all imported results are in Library/metadata.</li>
</ul>
