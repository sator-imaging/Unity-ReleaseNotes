## Linux Publishing



*   Export a standalone player for 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x86\_64) Linux.
    *   Select "Linux" from the Target Platform list in the Build Settings.
    *   After building a Linux player on Windows, you will first need to make the binary executable on Linux before being able to run it. Do this by running 'chmod +x' on the executable or right clicking and selecting "Allow to run as application".
*   Supported Platforms
    *   Standalone players will run on most modern Linux systems with vendor-supplied graphics drivers.
    *   Official support will be provided for 32 or 64-bit Ubuntu Linux, version 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) or newer, with graphics cards using vendor-supplied drivers.
