## 2D


### Added a new asset type: Sprite
<ul>
<li>Sprite is defined by a Texture2D, rectangle and a pivot point.</li>
<li>Sprite has an internal mesh generated based on pixel alpha values, PRO only feature.</li>
<li>Sprite supports vertex snapping (V)</li>
<li>Added Sprite under the "GameObject/Create Other/" menu.</li>
</ul>

### Sprite Mode added to TextureImporter
<ul>
<li>Single Sprite option will generate one Sprite using the entire texture.</li>
<li>Pixels to Units defines the mesh size of the Sprite to 1 / value.</li>
<li>Pivot property defines sprites center point.</li>
<li>Manual option allows custom Sprite definitions.</li>
<li>Sprite Editor button opens new window for editing sprites: Add / Delete sprites manually; Automatic and Grid based slicing; Change sprite names.</li>
<li>Extrude Edges property added to Advanced mode. It can be used to extrude the internal sprite mesh edges if needed for custom texture-space effects.</li>
<li>Mesh Type property added to Advanced mode. It can be used to change the type of mesh generated: Full Rect or Tight (PRO only feature).</li>
</ul>

### Added a new renderer component: SpriteRenderer
<ul>
<li>Renders one Sprite.</li>
<li>Does not requires a material to have _MainTex texture set.</li>
<li>Uses Material Property Blocks to patch _MainTex with the correct (original or atlased) texture for the active Sprite.</li>
<li>Supports dynamic batching with non-uniform scaling.</li>
<li>Color property sets the vertex color.</li>
<li>If no material is specified, Sprites/Default material (alpha-blended) is used.</li>
</ul>

### Added 2D mode button to scene view
<ul>
<li>Scene view axis widget is hidden on 2D mode</li>
<li>Scene view locks to the XY plane.</li>
<li>Move tool changes to a dedicated 2D tool with familiar functionality.</li>
<li>Move tool have special Keyboard modifiers</li>
<li>Picking is now alpha-based.</li>
<li>Dragging a sprite to the scene will create a new GameObject with a SpriteRenderer.</li>
<li>Dragging multiple sprites to scene will create a new GameObject with a SpriteRenderer and sprite animation.</li>
</ul>

### Sprite Packing (Atlasing), PRO only feature
<ul>
<li>Atlas is defined by changing the PackingTag property in texture importer.</li>
<li>Packing is based on the generated mesh.</li>
<li>Packing will respect texture import settings and will only pack textures together if format, usage mode, color mode, compression quality, filter mode and mip-map settings match.</li>
<li>Window/Sprite Packer menu option opens a new window for inspecting the automatically generated sprite atlases.</li>
<li>Decision of which sprites to place into which atlases can be fully customized by implementing a custom sprite packer policy (UnityEditor.Sprites.IPackerPolicy).</li>
<li>Packing is completely transparent to the user, works in Play mode and is compatible with asset bundles.</li>
</ul>

### Integrated Box2D physics engine and a set of 2D physics components
<ul>
<li>Rigid-body component (RigidBody2D) supporting static/kinematic/dynamic body, mass, linear/angular velocities, drag and auto-sleeping, and fixed-angle constraint.</li>
<li>Circle collider (CircleCollider2D) supporting a centroid and radius.</li>
<li>Box collider (BoxCollider2D) supporting a centroid and a size.</li>
<li>Polygon collider (PolygonCollider2D) supporting an arbitrary set of polygons. It can be initialized to the shape of a sprite by dragging the sprite onto the component.</li>
<li>Distance joint (DistanceJoint2D) supporting a hard maximum distance between rigid-bodies.</li>
<li>Hinge joint (HingeJoint2D) supporting linear and angular limits and motor drive.</li>
<li>Slider joint (SliderJoint2D) supporting an axis constraint, linear limits and motor drive.</li>
<li>Spring joint (SpringJoint2D) supporting  a soft (spring) distance between rigid-bodies.</li>
<li>Added a new physics material PhysicsMaterial2D to share friction and bounciness including default material support.</li>
<li>Added a 2D physics manager to contain scene settings such as gravity etc.</li>
<li>Added spatial queries in Physics2D scripting class for line and ray-casting and geometry overlap checks.</li>
<li>Added both trigger and collision callbacks for 2D colliders including collision points and normal.</li>
<li>Added 2D physics profiling information to the profiler.</li>
<li>Editor: Hold down shift to quickly modify 2D colliders.</li>
</ul>
