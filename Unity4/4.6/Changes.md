## Changes


### Editor Changes
<ul>
<li>T is now assigned as default shortcut key for Rect tool. The Sprite Editor trim shortcut key defaults to Shift-T to avoid conflict with the Rect tool. </li>
<li>Rect handles now do non-uniform scaling by default for consistency with a large range of other applications. Hold down shift to scale uniformly. </li>
<li>The preference default for script language in the Add Component dropdown has been changed from Javascript to C#, since that's the new default for documentation and examples.</li>
<li>Renamed spritePixelsToUnits to spritePixelsPerUnit in TextureImporterSettings.</li>
</ul>

### Graphics Changes
<ul>
<li>Stencil buffer is now available in Unity Free.</li>
</ul>

### 2D Changes
<ul>
<li>Sprite Packer is now enabled by default.</li>
<li>New Sprites now have mip-maps enabled by default.</li>
</ul>
