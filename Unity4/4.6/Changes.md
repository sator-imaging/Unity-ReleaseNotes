## Changes

- [Editor Changes](#editor-changes)
- [Graphics Changes](#graphics-changes)
- [2D Changes](#2d-changes)


### Editor Changes

*   T is now assigned as default shortcut key for Rect tool. The Sprite Editor trim shortcut key defaults to Shift-T to avoid conflict with the Rect tool.
*   Rect handles now do non-uniform scaling by default for consistency with a large range of other applications. Hold down shift to scale uniformly.
*   The preference default for script language in the Add Component dropdown has been changed from Javascript to C#, since that's the new default for documentation and examples.
*   Renamed spritePixelsToUnits to spritePixelsPerUnit in TextureImporterSettings.

### Graphics Changes

*   Stencil buffer is now available in Unity Free.

### 2D Changes

*   Sprite Packer is now enabled by default.
*   New Sprites now have mip-maps enabled by default.
