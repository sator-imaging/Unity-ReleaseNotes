# 6000.0.68f1 Release Notes

## Improvements

- `Shadergraph`: Improved appearance of channel dropdown on UV node when node is collapsed.
    ([UUM-115034](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/uv-nodes-label-is-cut-off-when-preview-is-collapsed))



## Changes

- `Editor`: Changed the Prismatic Articulation Joint type with targetVelocity set \(a velocity motored prismatic articulation joint\) so now setting the Target Velocity to a positive value results in a positive linear velocity during simulation. Similarly, setting the Target Velocity to a negative value will result in a negative linear velocity.
    ([UUM-113920](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prismatic-articulationbody-moves-in-opposite-direction-when-using-targetvelocity))

- `Graphics`: Texture importing now strictly adheres to the supported formats in https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/ImportingTextures.html. Circumventing this by changing an image file's extension will no longer work. If a image file format is necessary, please file a feature request so we can look into properly supporting it.



## Fixes

- `2D`: Fixed Sprite Editor Window info box is obstructed by module's UI.
    ([UUM-131899](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inactive-skinning-editor-toolbar-overlaps-the-help-box-in-the-sprite-editor-when-asset-is-not-editable))

    (UUM-133945)

- `Animation`: Fixed the broken documentation link in the AnimationWindowEvent inspector.
    ([UUM-131593](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/animation-event-is-missing-documentation-link))

- `Asset Bundles`: Fixed an issue where `AssetBundleUnloadOperation` allocations persist longer than expected and are not cleared until the next `GC.collect()`.
    (UUM-132703)

- `Bug Reporter`: Fixed crash in Bug Reporter when exporting offline report into a Unity project directory.
    ([UUM-129604](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/bug-reporter-crashes-when-exporting-offline-report-into-a-unity-project-directory))

- `DX12`: Fixed deadlock when maxQueuedFrames is 1 in the Editor when using D3D12.
    ([UUM-131962](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-freezes-when-qualitysettings-dot-maxqueuedframes-is-set-to-1-and-dx12-is-used))

- `Editor`: Added default Profiler modules list to Profiler modules introduction.

- `Editor`: Fixed a NullRefException that could be thrown by the inspector when the GameObject inspector would be disabled.
    ([UUM-130843](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/endlayoutgroup-beginlayoutgroup-must-be-called-first-error-is-thrown-when-manually-saving-a-complex-ui-prefab-asset))

- `Editor`: Fixed inconsistent ID values between Signing Team ID and iOS/tvOS Profile ID in External Tools.

    ([UUM-126778](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/publishing-settings-are-shared-across-different-custom-build-profiles-when-modifying-build-options))

- `Editor`: RefreshSettings when setting AssetPipeline settings in ProjectSettings.
    (UUM-129185)

- `Editor`: When reconnecting a plain GameObject to a prefab, keep any child instances.
    ([UUM-102262](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/child-prefab-instance-connection-lost-when-reconnecting-parent-prefab))

- `Editor`: Windows: Updating gameloop when the user right-clicks on the window title bar on a Run In Background application.
    ([UUM-124735](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/main-thread-freezes-when-right-clicking-on-the-title-bar-of-a-windowed-player-on-windows))

- `Graphics`: Fixed rare deadlock scenario in AsyncResourceUploadBlocking\(\) occasionally happening when loading resources \(typically Textures\) from AssetBundles.
    ([UUM-126066](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-the-application-freezes-during-the-assetbundle-loading))

    (PAK-8605)

- `Physics`: Fixed a crash when authoring Cloth components with scene reloading disabled. Entering Playmode right after authoring would still keep the Cloth instance in a "authoring only" state which means the underlying simulation object wasn't being created.
    ([UUM-110845](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-clothscene-processcomponentupdates-when-entering-play-mode-after-editing-cloth-collision-points))

    ([UUM-132879](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/expected-color-is-changed-to-black-when-using-swizzle-node))

- `Shadergraph`: Nodes are now properly selected after copy-paste or duplication.
    ([UUM-110841](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nodes-in-shader-graph-are-not-selected-when-they-are-duplicated))

- `UI Toolkit`: Fixed a null reference exception being thrown when a UI Document performed a live reload and had a missing script attached.
    ([UUM-129344](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nullreferenceexception-thrown-when-modifying-a-ui-document-while-a-scene-containing-a-gameobject-with-any-ui-document-and-a-missing-script-component-is-open))

    ([UUM-131863](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgpu-errors-with-unorm-and-half4-rwtexture))

    ([UUM-131262](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgpu-createrenderpipeline-errors-with-shadervariantcollection-warmup))
