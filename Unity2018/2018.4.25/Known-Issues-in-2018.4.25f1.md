<li><p>MacOS: [Mac] Many artifacts can be seen in Scene View when Scene Light is enabled and HDR is on with Metal API and Mac OS X 10.15.4 (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mac-many-artifacts-can-be-seen-in-scene-view-when-scene-light-is-enabled-on-with-metal-api-and-mac-os-x-10-dot-15-dot-4">1240265</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Package Manager: Immutable packages altered by the API Updater are reverted to their original state when packages are resolved, which can lead to slower import performance in that context.</p></li>
<li><p>Profiling: Performance issue in "Profiler" UI with increasing number of events (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/performance-issue-in-profiler-ui-with-increasing-number-of-events">967289</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Scene Management: Unity crashes when opening a project with two identical scenes, one of them being unloaded (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unity-crashes-when-opening-a-project-with-two-identical-scenes-one-of-them-being-unloaded">1069650</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>macOS: If the Android Tools are not installed through the Hub, macOS 10.15 (Catalina) default security settings will prevent the Android NDK binaries being executed. These settings have to be changed or a signed Android NDK (r16b) will be needed to build Android. More information here: https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/older_releases.</p></li>
