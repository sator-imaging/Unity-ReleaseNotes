*   Audio: Unity crashes in Play Mode at FMOD\_Resampler\_Linear ([928576](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unity-crashes-in-play-mode-at-fmod-resampler-linear))
    
*   Linux: Focus cannot be properly gained on play mode, making keyboard input switch screens ([1109908](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-focus-cannot-be-properly-gained-on-play-mode-making-keyboard-input-switch-screens))
    
*   Mobile: \[Android\] Keyboard doesn't show up when trying to input text in an Input Field with Hide Mobile Input checked on Android 11 ([1258071](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-keyboard-doesnt-show-up-when-trying-to-input-text-in-an-input-field-with-hide-mobile-input-checked-on-android-11))
    
*   Package Manager: Immutable packages altered by the API Updater are reverted to their original state when packages are resolved, which can lead to slower import performance in that context.
    
*   Scene Management: Building project when two identical scenes are open crashes the editor ([1266194](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/building-project-when-two-identical-scenes-are-open-crashes-the-editor))
    
*   Scene/Game View: Logging errors from background thread crashes the Editor when Error Pause is enabled ([1173657](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/calling-assetbundle-dot-loadfromfileasync-with-a-path-that-does-not-exist-crashes-the-editor-when-error-pause-is-enabled))
    
*   Shadows/Lights: \[Regression\] Directional light shadow artefacts in 2020.2.0a21 ([1271048](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-directional-light-artefacts-in-2020-dot-2-0a21))
    
*   Windows: Cannot activate license within a docker container ([1193364](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cannot-activate-license-within-a-docker-container))
    
*   macOS: If the Android Tools are not installed through the Hub, macOS 10.15 (Catalina) default security settings will prevent the Android NDK binaries being executed. These settings have to be changed or a signed Android NDK (r16b) will be needed to build Android. More information here: https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/older\_releases.
