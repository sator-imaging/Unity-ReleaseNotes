<li><p>Linux:  Focus cannot be properly gained on play mode, making keyboard input switch screens (<a href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/linux-focus-cannot-be-properly-gained-on-play-mode-making-keyboard-input-switch-screens">1109908</a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Package Manager: Immutable packages altered by the API Updater are reverted to their original state when packages are resolved, which can lead to slower import performance in that context.</p></li>

<li><p>macOS: If the Android Tools are not installed through the Hub, macOS 10.15 (Catalina) default security settings will prevent the Android NDK binaries being executed. These settings have to be changed or a signed Android NDK (r16b) will be needed to build Android. More information here: https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/older_releases.</p></li>
