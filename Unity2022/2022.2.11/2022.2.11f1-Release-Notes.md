### Features

*   SpeedTree: HDRP/Nature/SpeedTree8.shadergraph now uses its Subsurface Map for the Transmission Mask node to remove the unintended light transmission from tree barks and twigs. This also fixes the overly bright billboard lighting which didn't quite match the 3D geometry's lighting.

### Improvements

*   Package Manager: Extended support for specifying optional path and revision to Git URLs in SCP format.

### Fixes

*   2D: Fixed the Tile Palette repainting a position when doing a mouse drag at the same position. (UUM-27588)
    
*   Android: Unity will no longer wrap native crashes into java exceptions on Android, as has been the case, and will correctly forward signals to the previous handlers.
    
*   Core: Fixed a regression where the maximum number of job worker threads was reduced to 64 instead of 128. (UUM-25377, UUM-28400)
    
*   Editor: Enabled prevention of AsyncGPUReadback requests accumulation when the Editor is inactive. ([UUM-19169](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gameobject-with-asyncgpureadback-class-in-the-script-leaks-memory-when-the-editor-is-running-in-the-background))
    
*   Editor: Fixed an exception when using Renderer2D with FullScreenPassRendererFeature. ([UUM-25396](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/argumentnullexception-value-cannot-be-null-dot-error-when-using-the-post-processing-feature-full-screen-pass-renderer-feature-together-with-the-2d-renderer))
    
*   Graphics: Added an error message when enabling restricted keywords on a Material. ([UUM-3576](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crash-on-vkgetinstanceprocaddr-and-drawbuffersbatchmodeenabling-with-keyword-instancing-on-when-using-vulkan-opengles-and-metal))
    
*   Graphics: Fixed a crash when loading a zero-sized Texture2D asset. ([UUM-9343](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/editor-crashes-when-importing-font-material-asset))
    
*   IL2CPP: Enabled display of the name of each thread in native and third party profilers. (UUM-21136)
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed a compile error when you enable bitcode for an Android build. ([UUM-25113](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/an-undefined-symbol-error-is-thrown-when-building-with-the-fembed-bitcode-flag))
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed a potential .cpp file name collision when two assembly names differ only by a number at the end of their name. ([UUM-27951](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-build-can-fail-when-2-assembly-definitions-have-similar-names))
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed a race condition when creating generic class metadata. (UUM-26516)
    
*   IL2CPP: Fixed the incorrect custom attribute lookup on a field derived in a base class from a different assembly. ([UUM-27593](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/il2cpp-throws-errors-when-using-custom-attributes))
    
*   IL2CPP: Projects created prior to 2021.3 and opened in 2021.3 or newer could have their Managed Stripping Level incorrectly migrated to the new default value of Minimal when the old default of Low should have been retained. (UUM-19512)
    
*   Mono: Fixed a crash when using ConditionalWeakTable. ([UUM-25411](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/crashes-on-garbagecollector-collectincremental-when-entering-the-play-mode))
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue where a project with a large number of git dependencies would have resolution errors with error code 429 (Too Many Requests). The number of concurrent requests is six by default, but it can be changed by setting the `UPM_GIT_MAX_CONCURRENT_COMMANDS` environment variable. ([UUM-6049](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/rpc-failed-http-429-curl-22-the-requested-url-returned-error-429-error-message-appears-when-executing-git-commands))
    
*   Package Manager: Fixed an issue which prevented starting UPM when a `package.json` file containing `"type": "module"` was present on any of the ancestor directories. (UUM-18512)
    
*   UI Toolkit: Enabled users to edit a multiline textfield's value directly in the UI Builder Inspector. (UUM-15988)
    
*   UI Toolkit: Fixed an exception thrown when the user tries to enter a negative value for the Fixed Item Height attribute of a ListView, TreeView, etc. ([UUM-11324](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/argumentoutofrangeexception-value-needs-to-be-positive-for-virtualization-is-thrown-when-adjusting-fixed-item-height-into-the-negatives))
    
*   Universal RP: Fixed an issue where scenes were not marked dirty after changing the volume update setting on cameras. ([UUM-10812](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-scene-is-not-marked-as-dirty-when-volume-update-mode))
    
*   Universal RP: Prevent negative color and NaN write to TAA history. ([UUM-26709](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/temporal-anti-aliasing-taa-produces-severe-artifacting-when-quality-set-to-very-high))
    
*   Video: Fixed crashes when changing the source URL on some specific devices. ([UUM-29011](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-application-crashes-when-changing-the-source-url-of-a-video-player-in-android-v2))
