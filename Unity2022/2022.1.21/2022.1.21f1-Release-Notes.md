### Features

*   2D: \[com.unity.2d.pixelperfect\] Added URP Pixel Perfect Camera converter.

### Improvements

*   2D: \[com.unity.2d.psdimporter\] Improved import speed and memory allocation for psd/psb files by reducing the intermediate texture buffers.
    
*   Animation: Improved animation performance across the board
    
*   Undo System: The Undo history now records the name of changed properties ("Modified Intensity") instead of just showing "Modified Property"
    

### API Changes

*   Shaders: Added: Added an API to control shader memory usage at runtime. ([UUM-5583](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unlit-shader-uses-more-than-100mb-of-memory-when-in-player))

### Changes

*   Universal RP: Messages regarding reducing resolution for additional punctual lights are now only displayed in debug builds. ([UUM-10166](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/urp-reduced-additional-punctual-light-shadows-resolution-warnings-are-being-thrown-on-playmode-enter-slash-exit-1))
    
*   XR: The Oculus XR Plugin package has been updated to 3.2.1 with support for Quest Pro.
    

### Fixes

*   2D: Fix memory leak with the TilemapCollider2D when used with a CompositeCollider2D (UUM-15822)
    
*   2D: \[com.unity.2d.animation\] Fixed a case where moving vertices forcefully in the Skinning editor could cause a quad reset of the mesh. (DANB-7)
    
*   2D: \[com.unity.2d.animation\] Fixed a case where multi selecting Sprite Skins would cause a null reference exception to be thrown. (DANB-126)
    
*   2D: \[com.unity.2d.animation\] Fixed a case where pasting bones in the Skinning Editor would move bones rather than copy them.
    
*   2D: \[com.unity.2d.animation\] Fixed a case where setting IKManager2D's or Solver2D's weight to '0' doesn't update solver's effector position.
    
*   2D: \[com.unity.2d.animation\] Fixed an issue where selecting bones in the Skinning Editor after removing any bone in the skeleton will throw an exception.
    
*   2D: \[com.unity.2d.psdimporter\] Fixed an editor freeze caused by over allocating intermediate texture buffers. (DANB-140)
    
*   2D: \[com.unity.2d.psdimporter\] Fixed an issue where some layers would become invisible when merging multiple layers together. ([DANB-131](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/psb-file-layers-become-invisible-when-they-are-merged))
