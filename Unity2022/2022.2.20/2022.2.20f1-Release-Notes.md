### Improvements

*   URP: Added HDR Output override per camera.

### API Changes

*   Graphics: Added: Added CanvasRenderer.GetMesh API, analogous to CanvasRenderer.SetMesh.
    
*   Graphics: Added: Added `TextureImporterPlatformSettings.ignorePlatformSupport` to bypass platform format checks.
    

### Changes

*   IL2CPP: Ensure we get a MissingMethodException instead of a runtime crash in native code for non-AOT'd methods.

### Fixes

*   Android: Updated GetDeviceName() API to support SystemInfo.deviceName on API Level 32 or higher. (UUM-32514)
    
*   Asset Pipeline: Fixed an issue where incorrect paths could be returned for constant (internal) GUIDs, causing references to these assets to break. ([UUM-30074](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/render-pipeline-asset-references-are-not-saved-in-the-inspector-after-restarting-editor))
    
*   Core: Fixed leak in Job Debugger that would occur when using a NativeContainer's async `Dispose(JobHandle)` method. (UUM-27552)
    
*   Editor: Changing the download progress calculation in 2022.2 to use doubles when downloading asset packs on Android. ([UUM-32299](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-integer-division-that-will-only-give-0-or-1-assigned-to-a-float-should-be-floating-point-division))
    
*   Editor: Fixed a crash on object unload where GC incorrectly unloaded an object that was owned by the Content File system.
    
*   Editor: Fixed for flickering of the icons while auto expanding in the Hierarchy. ([UUM-29429](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hierarchy-item-is-flickering-when-dragging-over-item-and-auto-expansion-happens))
    
*   Editor: Fixed malfunctioning visual effects when MSAA is turned on. ([UUM-33235](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/lens-flare-and-post-processing-visual-effects-dont-work-when-msaa-is-turned-on))
    
*   Editor: Fixed test instability for ReorderRootGameObjectRaisesOnHierarchyWindowChangedEventCorrectly. (UUM-32392)
    
*   Editor: Optimized asset import logic to handle large amounts of files located in the same directory. ([UUM-17547](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/freeze-when-importing-a-large-amount-of-fbx-files))
    
*   Editor: Updated XR Interaction Toolkit to 2.3.2.
    
*   Graphics: Fixed an issue where SystemInfo.GetCompatibleFormat would return an incompatible format for certain depth-stencil formats + FormatUsage combinations. (UUM-3789)
    
*   Graphics: Fixed Caustics are not rendered on AMD GPUs. ([UUM-21350](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hdrp-caustics-are-not-rendered-on-amd-gpus))

It was also not working correctly with wired headphones, where the setting should have no effect. ([UUM-19505](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-if-force-ios-speakers-when-recording-setting-is-enabled-audio-is-playing-through-the-device-speakers-when-bluetooth-headphones-are-connected))
