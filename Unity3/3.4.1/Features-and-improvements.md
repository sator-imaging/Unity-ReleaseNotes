## Features and improvements

<ul>
<li>IME input: 
<ul>
<li>Exposed Input.imeCompositionMode, Input.compositionString and Input.compositionCursorPos to allow IME input handling in custom GUI code. This enables easy text entry for East Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and other languages with complex characters.</li>
