## Changes

<ul>
<li>Asset Import: Adjusted messaging around Substance Designer import removal.</li>
<li>XR: Android builds that enable ARCore no longer fail when the minimum Android SDK is less than 24.</li>
<li>XR: Standalone UWP applications targeting Windows Mixed Reality will now cause the OS to notify the user if the Mixed Reality components are not installed or a headset is not connected, rather than silently falling back to non-VR desktop mode.</li>
</ul>
