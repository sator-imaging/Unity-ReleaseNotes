## Improvements

<ul>
<li>Metal: Improved ETC texture format support</li>
<li>Metal: Make native plugin interface versioned, renamed IUnityGraphicsMetal to IUnityGraphicsMetalV1 to signal that explicitly (old name is kept around for backward compatibility)</li>
<li>UI: Improved the performance of the culling by RectMask2D.</li>
</ul>
