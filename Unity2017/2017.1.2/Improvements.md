## Improvements



*   2D: Sprite atlas packing will now spend less time reconciling sprite from cache atlas. Previously this was slow, especially in a new editor session.
*   Graphics: When using custom shadow resolution on a light, this resolution won't be clamped as usual, allowing to reach up to 8k shadowmap if needed.
*   iOS: Added an Marketing icon kind for iOS and a slot for a 1024x1024 App Store icon.
*   Tizen: Load the first scene during displaying Splash screen.
