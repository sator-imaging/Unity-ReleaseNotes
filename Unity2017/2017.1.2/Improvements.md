## Improvements

<ul>
<li>2D: Sprite atlas packing will now spend less time reconciling sprite from cache atlas. Previously this was slow, especially in a new editor session.</li>
<li>Graphics: When using custom shadow resolution on a light, this resolution won't be clamped as usual, allowing to reach up to 8k shadowmap if needed.</li>
<li>iOS: Added an Marketing icon kind for iOS and a slot for a 1024x1024 App Store icon.</li>
<li>Tizen: Load the first scene during displaying Splash screen.</li>
</ul>
