# 6000.3.9f1 Release Notes

## Changes

- `Editor`: Changed the Prismatic Articulation Joint type with targetVelocity set \(a velocity motored prismatic articulation joint\) so now setting the Target Velocity to a positive value results in a positive linear velocity during simulation. Similarly, setting the Target Velocity to a negative value will result in a negative linear velocity.
    ([UUM-113920](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/prismatic-articulationbody-moves-in-opposite-direction-when-using-targetvelocity))

If you don't do this, you'll notice that outline rendering is slightly thicker than it was before.

    (UUM-129743)

- `WebGL`: WebGPU: automatically handle textures that are bound to a shader for both read and write.
    ([UUM-131864](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/webgpu-cant-bind-compute-rwtexture-for-read-and-write))

- `WebGL`: WebGPU: fix pipeline errors using RWTexture2D textures in shaders and simplify the use of unorm RWTextures.
